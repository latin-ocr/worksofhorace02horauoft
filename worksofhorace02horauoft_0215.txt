mox ιι] Satire III. 201-

AEsopus’ son dissolved a peerl
Of price, the mring of his girl,
In vinegar,—to say, he’d quaffed
A cool five thousand at a draught.
Surely to fling it down a drain,
Or rushing stream, had been as sane.
The sons of Quintus Arrius there,
Of brothers that illustrious pair,
In all frivolities and sius,
In love of all that’s vicious, mins,
On nightingales would often dine,
Bought at a ransom. How‘ desine
Such preeious youths? Does black or white,
Madman or sage, denote them right ?

Suppose some bearded man should play
At odd and even half the day,
Make cars for teams of mice to dram—
Build mud-pie houses‚—on a straw
Ride cock-a-horse, you’d call him crazy.
If reason prove, that lackadaisy
Pining for love is even than this

More childish, that all one it is,
Whether you take your pasfime, rolled
In dust, like brat of three years old,
Or lie in tars, all sever heat,
Imploring at a wanton’s feet ; ·

 

Say, will you act, like Polemo,

On his conversion, long ago?

The signs discard of your disease,—
Your mits, the swathings os your knees,
Your mufflers* too‚—as he, 'tis said,
Slipped off the chaplets from 'his head,

⁴ It is not easy to define what these articles of dress were, which
seem to have distinguished '‘the curled darlings'' of Rome. They

seem to have been equivalent to ruffiee, coloured stockings, and showy
mvats.
