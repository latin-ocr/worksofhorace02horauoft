3 30 To Lollius. [noox 1.

‘Midst all, from books and wise men strive to know
What best will make lise’s current gently ssew,
So be not shaken still by vain unrest,
In search for what must still elude your quest:
Or racked by sears or idle hopes sor what
Is sure to prove of little worth when got,
Inquire if virtue be to culture due, ·
Or nature’s gift? How cares are made more few?
What clears the troubled saul from sels-annoy,
And gives tranquillity without alloy,—
Honours or wealth‚ or by side-paths to sti-ay.
Unseen of men, adown life's noiseless way?

As sor mysels, whene'er 1 sit and dream
By the cool waters of Digentia’s stream—
Which all Mandela drinks—that hamlet old,
Pinched into wrinkles by the winter's coldt*
What, think you, is my prayer ?—“ Let me possess
The goods that now I have, or even less!
Live sor myself the days Ι have to live,
So please the gods a few more days to give.
Books let me have, and stores to last a year,—
So ’scape a lise all ssutter, hope, and sear! '’
At this I stop. It is enough to pray
T0·Jove. for what he gives and takes away.
Let him give life and wealth: a well-poised mind,
T hat ’tis my business sor myself to find.

⁴ It is now well established that the Mandela here spoken of was
on or near the site of the modern Bardela, at the soot of Monte Canta-
lupo, in the valley of the Lioenza, the Digentia of the poet, a ineuntain
stream which passes near Horaoe's farm. and after running about six
miles, empties itself into the Anio. Mandela was, from its position. ex-
posed to cold winds from the north-eust, and therefore chilly in oontrast
with Horace's villa higher up the valley, the site of which he praises
(Epistle XVI. ante) sor the geniality of its climate (temperiem laudes).
