210 Satire I V. [ωσι 11.

Since only soothing mixtures should

Be taken, previously to foed,

You’ll better sluice the man within

With diluent more mild and thin.
Limpets and whelks the plague abate

Of bowels that are obstinate,

And leaves of sorrel, shredded fine,

But not without white Coan wine.
Molluscs are at their choicest‚ still,

What time the moon her horn doth filL'

But shellfish, nutritive and sound,

Do not in every sea abound.

There is your Lucrine mussels* he

Excels the clam of Baiae.

As oysters best at Circe,† so

Crabs at Misenumss finest grow,

And mild Tarentum, mild and calm,

For cockles bears away the palm.
Let no man rashly dcem, that his

The art of dinner—giving is,

Till he with subtlest skill can test,

How flavours differ, which are best.

than a marsh filled with reeds, Its fisheriee unere in Cioem's timothe 5
source ot* a large revenue. It was connected with the sea, but pro- J
tected from its inroads by a hage mole or dyke of very great antiquity. ,·
The lake was filled up to its present condition by the ashes and scoriae ξ’
from eruptions of Monte Nuovo in the early part of the sixteenth century.

a favourite marine retreat of the Romans, οἱ Cicero and Atticus among . Δ
others, and in later times of Tiberius and Domitian. It was famous κ

among epicuree sor its oysters, as we guther from the passage in the ¹
