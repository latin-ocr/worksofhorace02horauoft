“ Horace still chamas with graceful negligence,

And without method mlks us into sense,

will, like a friend, familiarly convey

The tmest notions in the oesiest way.

He who, supreme in judgment as in wit,

Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ,

Yet judg'd with coolness, tho' he sang widgfinu

His Precepts toech but what his ποι-15 inspire.”

—Pom
