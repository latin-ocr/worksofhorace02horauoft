40 Notas to tlte Odes.

Le pauvre en sa cabane, οἱι le chaume le couvre,
Est sujet ὲ. ses lois ;

Et la garde qui veille aux barrieres du Louvre
N 'en defend point nos rois.

De murmuret contre elle et perdre patience
11 est mal a propos 3

Vouloir ce que Dieu veut est la seule science,
Qui nous met en repos.’'

In exquisite finish of expression nothing finer than these lines can
be desired; and there runs through them a vein of feeling more
delioetely tendet than is to be found anywhere in Horace⁴ This
was probably due to the purer {aith of the modern, which insensibly
coloured the almost pagan tone of the poem. Malherbe' says of
himself, that he made Horace his breviary,—with what effect, these
lines prove.

Why does Horace in this Ode mention the snow on Soracte
especially, when the whole Sabine range of hius was equally in
view to any one looking from Rome? To mark, apparently, the
severity of the season. Soracte, standing out alone upon the plain
as it does, and reaching a much lower elevation than the Sabine
hius, was often clear of snow, when they were swathed in it. When,
therefore, it had donned a covering of white, this was a sure sign
that winter was at its worst ς then the only thing to be done was to
shut out the cold, and to get what comfort might be had—and that
is not small—out of old logs, old wine, and old books.

Allan Ramsay's paraphrase of this Ode has au the freshnoes and
vigour of Horace, with added touches of his own, not unworthy of
the original :—

“ Look up to Pentland’s tow’ring tap,
Buried beneath great wreaths of smw,
O’er ilka cleugh, ilk scaur and slap,
As high as ony Roman wa’.

Driving their ba's srae whins or tee,
There’s no ae gowfer to be seen,
Nor douser fouk wysing ajee
The byas bowls on Tamson's green.
