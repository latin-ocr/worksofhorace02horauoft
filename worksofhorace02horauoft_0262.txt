Satira VII. [noox 11.

Just as to both and each wrong-doer,

But doubly just as to the wooer?

And all the while your paramour

Is no such mighty prize, I’m sure.

She doesn't change her dress, like you,

Or steal out to the rendezvous,

Nor, like my v‘rench, devices frame

To charm you in the amorous game.

And why? Because she fears to trust

To vows, she knows are made in lust.

And yet for such a woman you,

And with your eyes wide open, too,

Wiu run your head against a wall,

Place fortune, life, good name, and an,

At mercy of the wrath you rouse

In her infuriated spouse l

You’ve come off safe? One might rely, sir,

Past fears would thenceforth make you wiser.

But no, not you. You’ll risk your ears,

To make yourself fresh qualms and scats,

And o’er and o’er fresh ruin brave,

Oh, thrice‚ ay, thirtyfold a slave Ξ

What beast‚ once free, would to the chain

He burst crawl basely back again? ¹
“ I'm no adulterer,” you cry.

No more, by Hercules, am 1

A thies, when I the silver plate

Most wisely don't appropriate.

Remove the risk, the bridle drop,

And see, where nature then will stop !
Are you my master—you, the thrall

Os hosts of passions great and small?

You, whom the praetor’s rod, though laid

Times without number on your head,
