Satira I.

Who sweeps the sees from pole to pole,

An, to a man,'protest·their sole

Inoentive thus to toil and sweat

Is'a bare competence to get,

On which to-some calm nook they may

Retire, and dream old age away.

Just as the tiny ant—*for this

Their favourite illustration is—

Whate'er it can, away will sweep,

And add to its still growing heap,

Sagacious duly to foresee,

And enter for the timeto bess

Tme sage, for when Aquarius drear

Enshrouds in gloom the inverted year,

She keeps her nest, and on the hoard

Subsists, her prudent care has stored3

whilst you nor summer’s fervent heat

From the pul-suit of walth can beat,

Nor fire, nor winter, sword, nor wrack ς

Nothing can «inunt, or hold you back, γ

As long as lives the emtum, who

Can brag he’s wealthier than you.
Where is the pbasure, pray unfold,

of burying your heaps of gold

And silver in some darkling hole,

With trepidation invyour soul ?.

Diminish them, you say, and down

They’u dwindle to a paltry crown.

But say you don’t, what beauty lies

In heaps, however huge their size?

Suppose your granaries contain

Measures ten thousandfold of grain,

Your stomach will not, when you dine,

Hold one iota more than mine.
