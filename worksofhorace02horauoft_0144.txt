1 30 Satire I V. [βοοκ 1.

You'll swim without a float !'' and so with talk like this he won,

And moulded me, while yet a boy. Was something to be done,

Hard it might be, ‘⁴ For this‚’² he’d say, “good wan-ant you
can quote‚'’

And then as model pointed to some public man of note.

Or was there something to be shunned, then he would urge,
“ Can you

One moment doubt that acts like these are base and futile too,

Which have to him and him such dire disgrace and trouble
bred?’'

And as a neighbour's death appals the sick‚ and by the dread

Of dying forces them upon their lusts to put restraint,

So tendet minds are oft deterred from vices by the taint

They see them bring on others’ names; 'tis thus that 1 from
those

Am all exempt‚ which bring with them a train os shamss and ,

woes.
Of lesser faults, all venial, all, 1 am the slave; but these
Will years, reflection, a frank friend extirpate by degrees.

At least, so let me hope ! for still when on my coueh 1 muse, ’

Or saunter in the porticoes, to tax myselfI use.

“This is the better course to steer: I will, by doing this,

Be happier, dearer to my friends3 that surely was amiss;

And shall I e'er so foolish be as do the like again?”

Thus do I mutter to myself; when I have leisme, then

Ι cheat the time with writing down my thoughts3 and this, 1
own, ’

Is one of those small faults of mine, which, if you won't
cendone,

Straightway all those that scribble verse I’ll summon to my
aid,—

And little wot ye of the hosts pursue the tuneful trade,—

And like proselytising Jews, we’ll make you out of hand.

Enrol yoursels a son of song in our poetic band!
