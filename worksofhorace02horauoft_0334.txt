EPISTLE XVII.
TO SCAEVAr

HOUGH your fine instinct, Scaeva,·¹· keeps you straight
In all your walk and converse with the great,
The views of your small friend may serve your turn,
Though in such matters he has much to learn.
A blind guide he; yet from his lips may fall
Some useful hints to guide your course withal.
If what you like be sweet unbroken rest,
And sleep till after dawn; if you detest
W'orry, and dust, and smother, and the din
Of cars and carts, and of a noisy inn,
To Ferentinum † you should straight repain—
You'll find things calm enough and quiet there.
Nor would Ι blame your choice ; for joy is not
Of wealthy men exclusively the lot,
Nor life a failure, that in corners lone
Moves from the cradle to the grave unknown.‡

* Of this Scaeva nothing is known. 1t is impossible. therefore, to
say whether he needed or profited by the worldly wisdom of this Epistle.
founded on long observation of the pains and disappointments, the
mortifications and the rebuffs, which wait upon those who haum the
antechambers of the great from motives of cupidity or ambitIon.

† Ferentinum, the modern Ferentino, was a small town on the Via
Latina. some forty-six miles from Rome. It has now a popfflation of
over 10,ooo¹ and being on the line of railway between Ronmand Naples,
is probably a livelier place than in the days of Augustus.

ss So ovid writes (Tristia. 111. 4. 25), “ Crede mihi. bene qni latua,

bene vixit.''
He has lived well, believe me, who has grown

From youth to age unnoted and unknown.
