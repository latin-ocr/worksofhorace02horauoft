Augustus, resolved to mark conspicuously the close of the first
tm years sor which the imperial power had been placed in his
hands, and the distinguished success which had attended his ad·
ministration and his anns, appointed a great festival, based upon
the model of the ancient Ludi Tarentini or Taurii. These had
been held in seasons of public mlamity or peril, to propitiate the
infernal deities Dis and Proserpina, who were, however, dropped out
of view on the present oomsion, and the festival held in honour of

- Apollo (the patron god of Augustus) and Diana. It was desirable

to have this festiva] regarded, not as something new and special,

ἒ but merely as the observance os a periodic solemnity. The Quin-

deoemvirs, therefore, were directed to consult the Sibylline Books,
and they reported that the cyclin period sor its celebratiou had

’ now revolved (8.0. 17). Ateius Capito, the celebrated jun'st, was
’ appointed to arrange the ceremonias, and Ilorace was requested
· toprepare an Ode. Τὶιε festival was celebrated with great splendour.

Ι It occupied three days and nights. The Ode was sung at the second
= ἦ hour os the night at the most solemn part of >the festival, when the

'5 emperor, attended hy the Fisteen Men who presided over religious

.⁸ 1 affairs, was offering sacrifice in person on the banks of the Tiber.
’,- , The chorus consisted of twenty-seven boys and the same number ,
⁷ of girls os noble birth, whose parents were yet living (patrimi
ᾗ and matrimi). See Ode vi. B. IV. supra, p. 165, which is gen-

’ ΞΣΠΞ regarded as one of the llymns sung at an earlier part of
