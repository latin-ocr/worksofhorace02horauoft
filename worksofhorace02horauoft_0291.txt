m m] To Julius Florus. 277

Celsus* what's he about? He needs, 1 ween,

To be well warned, as he before has been,

Bards should draw inspimtion from themselves.

And not from Palatine Apollo's shelves.†

Lat when some day the birds their seathers claim,

Stripped os his spoils. the jackdaw come to shame.
And you, where are you soaring? Say, what ground

With wild-thyme fragrant are you hovering round ΞΣ

Yours is a genius os no puny breed,

Cultured withal‚ nor lest to run to seed.

Whether you destly urge some client’s suit,

Or solve nice points of law with skill astute,

Or mould a charming layffor meh and all

The victor’s ivy wreath on you will sall.§

Ah, friend. could you abjure them, or fon-get,

'rhose mres that keep the mind upon the fret,

Then would you higher, nobler gists display,

And walk where heaveuly wisdom points the way!

Be this our aim, whate'er our station here,

Who to ourselves would live, and to our country dear!
Yet one thing more! Say, when you write, if you

'rhink os Munatius as you used to do,

Or if that breach, which caused us so much pain,

Patched badly up, has broken out again?
