A life that more os heartselt comfort brings

Thau kiugs have tasted, or the friends os kings.
Once on a time a stag, at antlers' point.

Expelled a horse he'd worsted‚ from the j0int

EnJ‘oyment of the pasture both had cropped ε

still. when he ventui-ed near it, rudely stopped.

‘rhe steed oelled in man's aid. and took the bit:

Thus backed‚ he charged the stag. and conquered it.

But woe the while! nor rider, bit. nor rein

Could he shake off. and be himself again.

So he who. saring poverty, bath sold

His sreedom‚ better than uncounted gold.

will bem· a master- and a master-'s laws,

And be a slave unto the end. because

He will not leam. what fits him most to know,

How sar, discreetly used. small means will go.

Wheue'er our mind's at war with our estate,

Like an ill shoe. it trips us. is too great:

Too small, it piuches. Thou art wisely bent

To live, Aristius, with thy lot content:

Nor wilt thou fail to chide in me the iteh,

Should it insect me, to be greatly rich :

For boarded wealth is either slave or lord,

And should itself be pulled, not pull the cord.
These near Vacuna's crumbling sane I've penned,

Blest, save in this, in lacking thee, my friends*
