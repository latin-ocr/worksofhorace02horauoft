EPISTLE 111.

το Jumvs nonus.

LORU8,* I try to leam, but try in vain,
Where Claudius now is pushing his campaign.
Do Thrace, and Hebrus locked in icy sleep‚
Or those famed Straits ’twixt neighbouring towers that
sweep,†
Or Asia's teeming plains and vine-clad slopes,
Arrest your progress or inflame your hopes ?
Then, τους the staff, that band of lettered men
1 long to know what works engage their pen.
Who with Augustus' doings fills his page,
And stamps his triumphs sor a distant age?
*What's Titius doing? Like a household word
Throughout all Rome his name will soon be heard,
Who, scorning homely mere and vulgar rin,
Of Pindar's fount has fearless quaffed his fill Ξ
How is he? Not sorgot me? With true fire
Fits he Thebes· measures to the Latian lyre?
Or swells the tragic sury in his veins‚
And rolls its thunders in mouth-filling strains?

⁴* Julius Florus, to whom this Epistle and also the Second Epistle of

’ the Second Book are addressed, had accompanied Tiberius when sent by Ἰ ,
Augustus (A.U.c. 734) to dethrone Artaxias, King of Armenia. He .

was obviously an intimate and valued friend of the poet's.
† The Hellaepont, with the towers of Hero and Leandgm at Saetos

and Abydos.
