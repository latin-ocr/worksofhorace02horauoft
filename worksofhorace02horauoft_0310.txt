EPISTLE ΙΧ.
το fuaemus eLAumus NERO.

EPTIMIUS ⁴* only understands, ’twould seem, Α
How high 1 stand in, Claudius, your esteem;
For when he begs and prays me, day by day,
Before you his good qualities to lay,
As not unfit to share the beart and hearth
Os Nero, who selects his staff sor worth ς
Χνὴεῐι he supposes you to me extend
The rights and place os a familiar friend,—
Much better than mysels he sees and knows,
How far with you my commendation goes.
Plea upon plea, believe me, 1 have used,
In hope he'd hold me from the task excused,

* Ode vi. Book 11. was addressed to this Titius Septimius. See note
to this Ode3 see, also. the Third Epistle of this Book. Addison men·
tions this Epistle in the ‘Spectator' (No. 493), as a J'udieious specimen
of what an introductionmshould be. It obviously had the desired effect.
Septimius was admitted into the suite of Tiberius Nem, and was serving
under him in the East‚ when Horace wrote the Third Epistle. in which
he asks Julius Florus, '‘What's Titius doing?'' and pays a high eom·
pliment to his powers as a poet.

Among the many good stories founded on apt quotations from
Horace, not the least happy is that of Sir Robert Peel's quotation of the
first line of this Epistle—‘ · Septimius, Claudi, nimir-un intelhgrit unus‚''
when appealed to by two friends who were disputing whether the pen-
ultimate syllable of “ nimirum '' was long or short. ‘⁴ It was always a
puzzle.'' said Sir Robert, “even in the days of Augustus, sor Horace
says there was only one man who knew all about it.” He then quoted
the line, and in so doing settled the controversy.
