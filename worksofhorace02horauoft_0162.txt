148 Satira VII. [mox 1.

That both were, and were known to be,
Courageous in supreme degree.
But let uve, that cold-blooded are, ι
Or matched unfairly, meet in war, j
Like Diomed and Lycian Glaucus, ²
T hen os hard blows they're sure to.ba1k us :
The weaker somehow quits the field,
Some presents pass, and truce is sealed.
Vain, then, all efforts to appease
The feud of combatants like these,
And so, what time our Brutus 0'er
Rich Asia sway as Praetor bore, Α
Rupilius fought with Persius: ne’er
Were seen so aptly matched a pair,—
No, not when Bacchius shook his fists
Against great Bithus* in the lists,—
So down to court, with souls aflame,
A mighty spectacle, they came.
First Persius states his case: a roar
Of laughter greets the orator.
He praises Brutus, praises all
His staff, and then begins to call
Brutus, great Brutus, Asia’s sun,
His friends, the good stars, all but one,
That one The King;-—-he was that pest,
The dog whom husbandmen detest.
So on like winter-stood he raves,
That bears down all before its waveS.
To all this torrent of abuse
With sarcasms cutting and profuse,
Such as among the vineyards fly,
Did the Praenestine make reply.

⁴* Bacchius and Bithus, the Scholiasts tell us, were celebrated gladi-
ators‚ who aster killing each his scote of men in the arena, ended with

killing each other.
