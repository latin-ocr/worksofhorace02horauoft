Satira VIII. 255

Porcius, who bohed, playful soul!
By way of joke, his bread oehes whole.
And, sor a further relidi, where
He scented something in the fare
Uncommon, Nomentanus, by
His finger marked it to the eye.
For we, 1 quote his very words,

In which lurked fiavours, quite, you’ll own,
Unlike what you have ever known?-
A fact beyond all question placed,

Of sparrow's gall and turbot's livet,
At the bare thought of which Ι shiver.
This over, “ Honey-apples you
will find, tabe on a ruddy hue,
ΙΨ he proceeded to explain, -Ζ ἰ
“ Plucked when the moon is on the wane.²' 'k χ 0Ὕῷίρ
How this should corne about, and why,

“ Unless of wine we drink whole seas,
Let us have larger cups than these 2 ²’
Then grew the visage of our host
Pale, for hard drinkers are what most
Hedrmdsastheyaseapttobe
Of shafts sarcastic over-free,
Or as, perhaps, full cups to pledge
Takes off the palate's subtle edge.
Soon were the wine-jars emptied dry
In their capacious goblets by
Vibidius and Balatro,
To follow-whom we were not slew—⁵
