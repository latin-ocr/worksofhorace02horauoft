Atahnge pdoe to denr¹astall
Οἱ fish is not the all-in-all,
Ualens you know preeisely⁹ which
Goes best with nuce, plain ωηατ or rich,
which, tried, will make the satetkguest
Stat fresh with oeawakened aest.
Π flabby meat offena your taste,
Your orbbd platters will be graced
By Umbrian boat, on aconas sed ς
For your Lautemioe porku, bned
On reeds and suehlike wamy foed,
Is very, very sar from good.'
The ωδ of kid is mely fine,
That has been chiefly fed 'on vine.
The secund hare’s forequarters vill
By epicura be askedfor stin.
Tiu 1 had the example shown,
'Ibe art wius utterly unknown
Ostelling when you taste a dish,
Theageandkindosbirdorfish.
There are, whose genius is confined
To finding out some novel kind
Of pastry-erust5 but one should ne'er
On only one thing waste his care 3
Which simply is, as though you should
Take pains to see the wine is good,
But never give a thought to test
The οἰ1, in which the fish is dressed.-
Expose your Massic, when the sky'
Is clar, and the bouquet will fly,
Tlmt hurts the nerves so ; and the wine
Benmh the sost night air refine;
But, stt-ained through linen, then is all
Its flavour ruined past recall. ’
