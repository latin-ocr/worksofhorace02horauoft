EPISTLE Ι.

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS.

INCE you alone, Ο Caesar, bear the weight
Of Rome's affairs so manifold and great,
The country and its weal by arms defend, ’
Adorn by mon-als, and by laws amend.
1 should be guilty of a public wrong,
1r by my prattle Ι detained you long.
The doers os great deeds in times of old,
For which they now are with the gods enrolled.
Romulus, Bacchus, Castor, Pollux, when
Taming wild regions and still wilder men,
Staying the deadly ravage of the sword,
Allotting lands, and building towns, deplored
That goodly works and noble service done
From those they served such scant requital won.
Even he who crushed the Hydra, and subdued
By his predestined toils the monster-brood‚
Was doomed by sore experience to own,
That envy is subdued by death alone.
The xnan who shines pre-eminently bright,
And by his lustre pales each lesser light,
'Is little loved while living; Iet him die, „
And that same man’s adored by low and high.
