1 82 satire II. [mox 11.

Yet he on occasion will find himself able
To enjoy without hurt a more liberal table,
Say, on festival days, that come round with the year,
Or when his strength's low, and eries out for good cheer,
Or when, as years gather, his age must be nursed
With more delicate care than he wanted at first.
But sor you, when ill-health or old age shall besan,
Where's the luxury left, the relies within eall,
Which has not been forestaued in the days of your prime,
When you scoffed in your strength at the inroads of time?
“ Keep your boar till it’s rank Ι ” said our sires ε which arose,
I am confident, not from their having no nose,
But more from the noti0n‚ that some os their best
Should be kept in reserve for the chance os a guest;
And though, ere he came, it grew stale on the shelf,
This was better than eating all up by one's sels.
Oh, would Ι had only on earth found a place
In the days of that noble heroic old race!
Do you set any store by good name, which we find
Is more welcome than song to the ears of mankind? ·
Magnificent turbot, plate richly embossed,
Will bring infinite shame with an infinite eost.
Add, kinsmen and neighbours all furious, your own
Disgust with yourself, when you find yourself groan
For death, which has shut itself off from your hope,
With not even a sou left to buy you a rope.
“ Most excellent doctrine !’' you answer‚ “and would
For people like Trausius be all very good;
But 1 have great wealth‚ and an income, that brings
In enough to provide sor the wants of three kings.'’ '
But is this any reason, you should not apply
Your superfluous wealth to ends nobler, more high?
You so rich, why should any good honest man laek?
Our temples, why should they be tumbling to wrack ?
