 

, teman] To Augustas. 357

Of temple-gates on Janus closed and ban-ed,

Janus, of peace custodian and guard,

And Parthia. taught to dread the Roman name

By the mere echo of our Camars same.

Oh that my gists might with my wish compete!

But trivial lays sor you were all unmeet.

Nor dare 1 hazard powers, I know so srail,

Upon a task where they persorce must fail.

Officious zea] by indiscretion proves

A bane. moreover, even to those it loves:

And never less than when it spends its pains

On panegyrics pitched in high-flown strains;

. For we loem quicker, gladlier recollect

What makes us laugh, than what commands respect.
Azeal that does me harm 1 deem atax:

Nor wish have 1 to see myself in wax

Made plainer thau 1 am, or find my name

Renowned in verses lumbering, halt, and lame;

Lest shame should make me redde:- than my bust‚

And 1, together with my minstrel‚ thrust

Into an open case, be carried down

To that too fragrant quatter of the town,

Where pepper, persume, frankincense are sold,

And all the wares one sees in still-born books uprolled.⁴¹·
