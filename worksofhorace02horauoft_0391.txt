sNow, if my judgment be not much amiss,
The charm and worth of order lie in this.— ·
Insaying just what should justjhen-be said,
And holding· much that comes into the head
Deliberately back sor future use,
When it may just the right effect produce.

In choice of words be cautious and select,
Dwell with delight on this, and that reject.

No slight success will be achieved, is you

By skilsul setting make old phrases new.

Then. should new tenns be wanted to explain

Things that till now in darkness hid have lain,

And you shall coin. now here, now there, a
word,

Which our bluff ancestors have never heard,

Due leave and licence will not be refused,

If with good taste and sound diseretion used.

Nay, such new words, if stom a Grecian source.

Aptly applied, are welcomed as of course.

To Virgil and to Varius why forbid

What Plautus erewhile and Caecilius did?

Or why to me begrudge a few words more,

Is 1 can add them to my scanty score,

When Cato and old Ennius revelled each

In coining new words that enriched our speech?

A word that bears the impress of its day

As current coin will always find its way?

As sorests change their foliage year by year,
Leaves that came first, first fall and disappear;
So antique words die out, and in their room
Others spring up, of vigorous growth and bloom.
-Ourselvae, and all that's ours. to death are due:
And why should words not be as mortal too?

⁴* For, as Pope says, ‘¹ Use will father what's begot by sense.”
