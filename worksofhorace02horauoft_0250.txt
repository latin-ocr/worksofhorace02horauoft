rarely diversified in outline and in colour. Every now and theu
we get beautiful glimpses up side vaneys that look worthy to be
explored, and here and there on the other side of the Anio are seen
traces, in the ruins of the claudian Aqneduch os the magnitude of
the works designed by the Romans to supply their city with that
first essential for benith and comfort, of which we are ourselves only
beginning to understand the importance. Their suceessors, no las
wise in this respect, have not negleeted the same sources of supply,
and a eapacious aqueduct of modern structure, that may be seen
close to the road, black and ungainly as it is where its puch-covered
conduit comes above the level of the soil, shows no small en-
gineering skill and ingenuity in the way it has been carried across
the ravines and through the spurs of the hills which it has to
traverse in its course. The soenty pop'ulation is for the most part
busy in the fields, cleaving the clods with the mattock or driving a
clumsy plough through them, as their Sabine progenitors did when .·

bed. If there has been rain among the hills, its torrent, naturally
clear, but now turbid as the yellow Tiber and from the same cause, τ’
