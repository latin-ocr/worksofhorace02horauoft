382 T lte Art of Poetty.

still, sor your play ’tis better to employ

The well-known phases of the tale of Troy,

T han be the first in drama to unsold

Things until now unheard-of and untold.

Into possession, too, you will reduce

Materials that are free for all men’s use,

If only you take care you are not found

Pacing the vile old tedious mill-horse round ς

Nor try, by slavish emulation stirred,

To reproduce your Homer word sor word;

Nor, sticking all too closely to his text,

In setters move, tame, halting, and perplexed.
Neither commence, like the old Cyclic hard,

‘⁸ Of war I sing, and Priam evil-starred! ” ἤ

What can come after, fit to stand beside

A line that sets the mouth agape so wide?

The pangs of labour rend the hills, and all

T hat’s born’s a mouse, ridiculously small.

Oh how much better he who in bis lay

Ne'er strains a point. nor throws a word away l

stamp upon them that made it all his own—proprie communia dixit.
He did it, too¹ in the very way indicated by Horace.

‘¹‘ Fortunam Priami cantabo et nobile bellum. What was amis in
this to call down Horaee's censure, is not very apparent. 1t is sug·
gested by M. Baton, in his Commentary on this Epistle (Bmxenoe,
1857, p. 110). '‘que le reproche d'Horace tombe ici non seulement sur
la pretention assez impertinente, hic promissor, de traiter toute oette
noble guerre de Troie, mais encore sur la grande ouverture de bouehe.
tanto hiatu, qu'exigait la prononciation de ces trois longues (syuabes)
cantabo, jetees au milieu des vers.''
