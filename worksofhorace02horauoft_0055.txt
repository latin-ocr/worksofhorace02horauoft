Leeve to the gods yonr ilka eure,
If thnt they think us worth their while,
They een a rowth ο· blessings spate,
Which will ont sashious (ears beguile.
For what they have a mind to do, ⁹
‘rhat will they do, though we gang wud3
1f they command the storms to blaw, ”
Then upo' sight the hailstanes thud.

⁷ But soon as e'er they cry, Be quiet,

Tbe. blatt’xing winds dare nae mair move,
But eower into their envas, and wait

The high command of sov’reign Jove.

Let neist day come as it thinks fit,
The present minute’s only ours3
On ple-sure let’s employ our wit,
And langh nt sormne's secklecs powers.

Be sure ye dinna quit the grip
of ilka joy, when ye are young,
Before anld age your vitals nip,
And lay ye twafauld o'er a rung.

Sweet youth's a blythe and hansome time ;

Then lads and lassa, while it’s May,
Gne pou the gowan in ἰὼ prime,
Before it wither and demy.

Watch the sast minutos of delight,

When Jenny speaks benoeth her brath,
And kisses, laying a’ the wyte

On you, if she kep any skaith.
