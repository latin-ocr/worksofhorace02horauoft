342 To A ugytstus. [noox 11.

To you, while yet on this our earth you stay.
The tribute we of well-won honours pay,
Rear altars to your praise, and set your name
Above all past, above all future fame*
But this your people, though so just and wise,
You more than heroes of old Greece to prize,
Yea, more than Rome's of the great days gone by,
To other things a different rule apply,

⁴‘ When the Romans had made the first step towards making gods os
men by deifying Julius Caesar aster his death. those who aspired to
taking his place on earth were 'not slow to claim divine honour sor
themselves. Sextus Pompeius, aster his maritime victories over 00-
tavius, proclaimed himself the son of Neptune (see Epode lx.. ante. p.
17). Antony, soaring a flight higher. aspired to the name and honours
os Bacchus. When Octavius. A.U.c 718, shattered the fleet of Sextus
Pompeius, and again aster his crowning victory at the battle os Actium,
the enthusiasm of the Italian states led thern to place his statue by the
side of their protecting deities. In the Roman dependencies in the
East matters went further, and he was sorthwith worshipped as a god.
T emples were built to him. and a regular worship established. At a
later period the same feeling vented itseli' in some ot* the provinces of
the west in the erection of altars to his honour 3—but, in compliance
with his known wishes, these were generally combined with altars to
the Dea Roma. Augustus is said to have disclnimed such honours, ns
altogether unmeet while he was still alive. and. according to Suetonius,
he would allow neither temple nor altar to be erected rto him in Rome
(ln urbe quidem pertinacissime abstinuit hoc bonon, Suet. Aug.. 52).
Such things might have provoked a criticism there from which they were
sase in the provinces, while they were acceptable to Augustus as imply-
ing a not unpleasing acknowledgment of his popularity. A solemn em·
bassy οἱ the inhabitants os Tan-agona mme to him on one occasion to
annonnce to him that he was the author of a mitade. A fig-tree had
sprouted on his altar there. “Ah.'’ was his reply, “itis veryclensyou do
not burn much incense upon it !'' (3 Dion„ li. πο.) But while Augustus
sorbade the establishment of a public religious worship in his honour at
Rome, this did not prevent the Romans from placin‘his statue among
their household gods, and paying divine honours to it. Horaoe's words
seem to attest the existence os this species of adoratiom and he would
not have spoken of it in writing to Augustus himself, had he not been
well assui-ed that mention of the practice was not distasteful to him.
It was the reverence os men grateful for the security which the succenses
and the able administration of Augustus had brought to their homes.
To understand it we have but to read Horace's Ode V. Book lv,
