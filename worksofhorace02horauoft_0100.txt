86 Notes to tlte Ε podes.

The speculations as to who and what Canidia was, in which scholars
have indulged, point to no satisfactory conclusion. That she was
a real personage, and most obnoxious to the poet, is certain from
the peculiar venom with which he denounces her, not only here
but in the Satire Ι. 8, as well as from the sarcastic Recantation and
Reply, which form the Seventeenth Epode.

Young children supplied a favourite condimeut to the witches of
modern Europe, as well as to those of Horace’s days. From them,
according to Baptista Porta, was procui-ed an ointment, which,
rubbed into the skin, enabled the “filthy hags,” the Canidias and
,Saganas of a more recent period, to mount in imaginationi into the
air, and to enjoy amorous dalliance with their paramours. Thus
in Scot’s ‘ Diseoverie of witchcrast’ we find the following recipe for
this precious embrooetion cited from that great N aponum author-
ity: ‘⁴ The fat of young children, and suthe it with wala· in a
brazen venel, reserving the thickest of that which mainetii boiled
in the bottom, which they lay up and keep, until occasion serveth
to use it. They put hereunto Eleosdinum, Aconitum, fivndes
populeas (mountain-parslot, melfis-bane, leaves qs the poplar), and
soot.’' ‘⁴ They stamp all these together, and then they rub all parts
of their bodies exceedingly, till they look red and be very hot, so
as the pores may be opened, and their flesh soluble and loose.”
By this means in a moonlight night they seemed to be oerried. in
the air, to feasting, singing, dancing, kissing, culling, and other
acts of venery, with such youths as they love and desire most.”—

Reginald Soot gives, from Baptista Porta, an anecdote which
explains the delusions under which the belief in witchcrast flour-

' ished, and led so many wretched outcasts to the pond and the

stake :—

“N ow‚” saith he (Porta), “when Ι considered thoroughly here·
of,· remaining doubtful of the matter, there sen into my hands a
witch, who of her own accord did promise to fetch me an errand
out of hand from sar countries and willed all them whom 1 had
brought to witness the matter to depart out of the chamber. And
when she had undressed herself, and frotted her body with certain
ointments (which action we beheld through a chink or little bole
of the door), she seu down through the force of these soporiferous

or sleepy ointments into a most sound and heavy sleep, so as we did ⁷ ’ὲ
