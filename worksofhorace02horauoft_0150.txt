136 Satira V. Α [noox ι.

We laugh. “ I'm for you !'' Messius said—
“ Lay onl'' and then he shakes his head.
“ Oh !'’ cried Sarmentus, “if your horn

What frightsul lengths would you not go,
When, crippled, you can menace so?”

Σ The modern Benevento, ten miles from Caudium. Here the Via

Appia diverged into two branches. one, the Via ijana, towards Apulia,
and the other and more southern through Venusia to Tarentum.
