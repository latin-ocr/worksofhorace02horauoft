sor posterity—one can scarcely tell why, sor his description has “
nothing to do with the main object of that Epistle. Here are

the “continui montes,'’ with the valley between them, so placed

that the morning sun strikes upon the hill to the right, while in the

asternoon it sucks up the moisture from that to the lest. Here is ⁷
the delicious crisp air, mellowed by the mountains, which shelter it ,
from the cold northern and eastern winds. Here is the stream that
still as much as ever is “ multa mole docendus apm'co parcere prato. '’ ἰᾗ
There was a contadino hard at work trying to enforce the leeson ξ
when we visited the spot yesterday, and obviously not without good ἑ
cause. Here are the “quercus et ilex” that fed Homoe’s flock 1
“ multa fruge,’ ' and delighted their master with their boantisul shade. —
That shade is not so bountisul now, and there is not that wealth of ’-
greenery which in Horace's time recaued the luxuriant verdum of v
Tarentum. Here, too, a little farther on is the sountain‘ ‘aiam ¹

   
   
   
    
  
   

rivo dare nomen idoneus? and which the pensants will tell you acts ·
to this day as the best of medicina sor heedaches and indigestion— γ

“Infirma capitifluit utilis, utilis alvo. ” As we look round, it is of ’
little moment whether the villa stood where, upon the strength of
some remnants of mosaics, itis said to have stood. It was not that .
which made the charm of the place to Horace, but the secluded ¹
valley, girdled by the lonely hills, sar from the stit and moke aad ,
busy idleness of the great city3 it was the simple habits andhomely
virtues of its peasantry which he found there, and the opportunities ,
for genial intercourse with them and with the dioioe fi-iends who ’
made their way from Rome upon occasion to enjoy the poet’s γ -
companionship and hospitality. Looking up the slopes of the valler Δ ·
of Ustica (“ Usticae cubantis '')‚ and round upon the amphitheatoe of ἕ
hius, we feel with a soree unfelt before what was in Horace’s hart
when he exclaimed—

“ O rus, quando ego te adspiciam 9 Quandoque &ubit
Nunc veterum libris, nunc somno et mnibus kent,
Ducere sollicitaejucnnda oblivia viba 1⁸

‘⁸ Oh, when shall 1 the country see,
Its woodlands green 2> oh, when be fiee,
With books of great old men, and deep,
And honis of droemy ease, coereep
Into oblivion sweet os life,
Its agitations and its strife ²⁸·

Hills, sountain, brook, river, meadow, here we have them au bes J ¹
