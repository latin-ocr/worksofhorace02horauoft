EPODE XVII.
HORACE’S RECANTATloN 'ro cAmmA.

H ERE at thy feet behold me now
Thine all-subduing skill avow,

And beg of thee on suppliant knee,

By realms of dark Persephone,

By Dian's awful might, and by

Thy books of charms which from the sky

Can drag the stars, Canidia,

To put thy magic sleights away,

Reverse thy whirling wheel main,

And loose the spell that binds my brain !
Even Telephus to pity won

The ocean-cradled Thetis’ son,

'Gainst whom his Mysian hosts he led,

And his sharp-pointed arrow sped.

The man-destroying Hector, doomed

By kites and dogs to be consumed,

Was natheless by the dames of Troy

Embalmed, when, mourning for his boy,

King Priam lest his city’s wall,

At stem Achilles’ feet to fall.

. Ulysses’ stalwart rowers, too,

Away their hide of bristles threw

At Circe's word, and donned again

The shape, the voice, the soul of rnen.
Enough of punishment, I'm sure,

Thou hast compelled me to endure,

Enough and more, thou being dear

To pedlar and to marinere Ξ
