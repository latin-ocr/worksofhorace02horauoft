Satire I.

By dread that he should die of sheer
Starvation. Well, the sequel henr!
His housekeeper, tried past all bearing,
With more than Clytemnestra's daring
Resolved to‘cure him of his pain,
So cleft him with an axe in twain.

“ What is the counseL then, you give?
That 1 like Maenius should live,
Or Nomentanus ?'' Are you mad?
Extremes in either way are bad.
When 1 dissuade you from the vice
Os grasping, sordid avarice,
1 do not counsel you to be
A spendthrist and a debauchee.
A line there is, not hard to draw,
’Twixt Tanai's and the sire-in-law
Of young Visellius. Yes, there is
A moen in all such things as this ς
Cermin fixed bounds, which either way
O'erstep‚ and you must go astray.

And so this brings me round again
To what I started stom, that men
Are like the miser, all, in this:
They ever think their state amiss,
And only those men happy, who
A different career pursue;
Pine, if their neighbour’s she-goat bears
An ampler store of milk than theirs;
Ne'er think how many myriads-are
Still poorer than· themselves by sar,
And with unceasing effort labour
To get a point beyond their neighbour.
So does some wight‚ more rich than they
For ever bar their onward way3
