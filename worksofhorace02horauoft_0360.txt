346 To Augustus. [ωσι 1¹.

Is it admire, extol old sons of song
As fine beyond comparison, ’tis wrong;
Is it allow, that here and there we meet
In them with things are wholly obsolete,
With passages obscure, and harsh, and rough,
And not a little common careless stuff,
Then I conceive it judges as itv should,
And Jove himself approves the judgment good.
No furious zealot I on points of taste,
Nor would I wish to see from earth effaced
Old Livius’ poems, which with ruthless cane
Orbilius whipped into my boyish brain ; ἴ·
But when 1 hear them sor their polish praised,
Called charming. all but perfect, I’m amazed.
1f here and there he hits a happy phrase,
Or some fine lines illuminate his lays,
They carry off his thousand saults so well,
That quite against all rule his poems sell.

It makes me wroth to hear a work run down
simply because it burst upon the town
Within the last few months, and not because
Its thoughts are poor, its diction full of flaws,
While not indulgence merely, but rewards
And high renown, are claimed for ancient ban-ds
A piece of Atta's‚ should 1 hint the thought,
That it goes off less briskly than it ought,

⁴* T. Livius Andronicus is mentioned by Quintilian as the oldest
Roman poet. He flourished about the middle of the third century bo-
sore Christ. One of his works was a translation of the odyssey. and
to learn this by heart was no doubt the task which Orbilius enforoed by
the birch upon the boy Horace. Being a harsh and lumbering pieoe
of work, it must have been hateful to the boy ; and it says something
sor Horace's good sense, that what his boyhood ‘¹ det-stem· and with
twofold cause, his manhood did not, like Byron with regatd to Hor-
ace's own works, ¹⁸ still abhor.''
