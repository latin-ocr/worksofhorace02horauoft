But 1 have said, he’s muddy in his ᾗσιν,1
Ostsweepingomwithmuch that’sfinethingslow
And-athlas. Wen! Do you,whofireatthis,
In mighty nomet’s sels find naught amis?
Dooenot Lucilius use his counly file
To round and polish tragic Accius’ style?

Nay, of old Ennius makes he not a jaet

For lines whose poverty must be confessed,
whilstofhimselfhe spaekgasnot one whit
Abovethemenatwhomheshootshiswit?
Why, in Lucilius, then, when ost we fall

On venes rugged and musical,
Shouldwenotaskourselvae, is'tishisfault,
Orhisharshtheme’sthat makesthunjarandhalt?
Asifwithinsixseetitwereenough ⁴

To close up any skimble-skamble stuff,

should a man boast of scribbling off, before

He sits to supper, verses some tenacem,

And, after supper-time, as many more ?

Like 'ruscan Cassius, whose great flux of song,
Swifter than rushing rivers, swept along,

And whose own countloes manuscripts, ’tis said,
Sei-ved sor his funeral pyre, when he was dead.†
Playful and scholarly, 1²11 own to you,

Lucilius may have been, more polished too,
Than him, who first his uncouth ventum made
In mensures which the Greeks had ne'er essayed.
