Satire J.

To think, is prized, and prized alone
For just so much as he may own.
What’s to be done with fools like these?
Let them be wretched, if they please!
They have their comforts, it appears,
Like that rich knave‚ who met the jeers
Of the Athenian mob with this:
‘⁸ The people hoot at me, and hiss,
But 1 at home applaud myself',
When in my chest 1 view my pelf.''

See Tantalus, patched sinner, gasp
To catch the stream that slips'his grasp!
Nay, smile not! change the name; of you
Τὴε story will be quite as true.
With panting breath and sleepless eye,
Upon your hoarded bags you lie,
And can no more their stores abridge,
Than is to touch were sacrilege,
But gaze and gloat on them, as though

They were mere pictures. Would you knoxv,

What money can avail, and what

The uses 'may from it be got?

Buy broad, some herbs, a flask of wine,
To these add whatsoe’er, in fine,

Our human nature, if denied‚

F eels pinched sor and unsatisfied.

That’s common—sense. But, day and night,
To watch and ward, half dead with fright,
To live in dread of thieves and fire,

N ay, let your very servants tire

Your soul with panio, lest they 'strip

’ Your house, and give yourself the slip,

If these the joys that riches give,
Heaven keep me beggared while 1 live!
