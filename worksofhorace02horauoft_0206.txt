192 Satira III. [noox 11.

Divine and human. Gain that prize,
You're noble, valiant, upright, wisc,—
Shall we say, wise ?-ay‚ king, or aught
You choose witha-l. So wealth, as fraught
With virtual worth, he hoped, would claim
Conspicuous honour for his name.

Now Grecian Aristippus, see,

How very different was he,

Who in the Lib‘yan desert told

His slaves to throw away his gold,
Because its weight their pace retarded?
Which of these two shall be regarded

As madder than the other?

DAMASIPPUS.
Why
Attempt to solve one puzzle by
Another ?
STERTINIUS.

If a man shall fill
His house with lutes, who has no skill
In fingering the lute, and who’s
Indifferent to every Muse;
If one, who makes not shoes‚ buys lasts
And paring-knives,-another, masts
And sails, who never goes to sea,
And loathes all commerce‚-these will be
By all the world most rightly thought
stark staring madmen. Well, in what
Is his case different from theirs,
Who piles up wealth, but never dares
To spend, regarding it as much
Too sacred even for him to touch?
