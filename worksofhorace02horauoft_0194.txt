180 Satira II. , [uoox 11.

“I like,'' eries the glutton, whose ravenous gullet
A harpy might envy, “to see a huge mullet, ·
On a huge dish set out.'' Come, wast, you south wind,
A taint on the meats of all men of this kind!
Even boar and fresh turbot taste flat, you’ll confess,
NVhen the stomach is weary and sick with excess.
An overcloyed palate thinks nothing so nice is,
As sharp elicampane, or turnips in slices :
Nor have all simple things been quite driven away
From the boards of the great. For there, to this day,
Common eggs and black olives ean still find a place,
And Gallonius not long since fell into disgrace
For extravagance such as none ought to afford—
A sturgeon presented entire at his board. ἱ
“ Why, a sturgeon?'’ you ask ; “ did the sea, then, produce
Fewer turbot than now it maintains for our use?'’ „
No; but then in its ooze sase the turbot might rest,
And safely the stork brooded on in its nest,
Till that praetor, for suffrages vainly entreating,
Discovered and taught both were excellent oeting. ¹
So were any one now to assure us a treat
In cormorants roasted‚ as tender and sweet‚
The young men of Rome are so prone to what's wrong,
They’d eat cormorants all to a man before long.

Ev'n Ofellus will own there's a wide gap between
A table that’s frugal and one unat is mean.
One vicious extreme it isidle to shun,
If into its opposite straightway you run.
There is Avidienus‚ to whom like a bun· ἶ
Sticks the name he was righteously dubbed by of “ Cur‚’' Α ’
Eats beech-mast‚ and olives five years old at least, Δ
And ev'n when he's robed all in white for a feast,
On his marriage or birthday, or some other very
High festival day, when one likes to be merry,
