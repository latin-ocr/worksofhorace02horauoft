246 Satira VII. [mox 11.

“ You go out on compulsion only.
'Tis so delightsul to be lonely3
And drinking bumpers is a bore
You shrink from daily more and more.''
But only let Maecenas send
Command for you to meet a ffiend,
Although the message comes so late,
The lamps are being lighted, straight,
“ Where’s my pomade? Look sharp! '' You shout,
“ Heavens ! Is there nobody about?
Are you all deaf?'’ And, storming high
At all the househoId, off you fly.
WVhen Milvius, and that set, anon
Arrive to dine, and find you gone,
With vigorous curses they retreat,
Which Ι had rather not repeat.
Although it may with truth be said,

That I am by my belly led,
That I’ve a nose, which scents good cheer
Of all sorts, far away or near,
That I’m a dolt and love my ease,
And given to tIppling‚ if you phase,
Should you, who're quite as bad as 1,-
It may be worse,—at me let fly,
As though you were a saint, and 0'er
Your sins a dainty varnish pour?
How were it, should you, by all rule,
Be shown to be a bigger sool
Thau me, a poor slave misbegot‚
For some five hundred drachmas bought?
Away with that terrific frown!
Keep both your hand and temper down,
Whilst I repeat, what I by old
Crispinus’ janitor was told}
