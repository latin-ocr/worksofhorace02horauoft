EPISTLE XV.

TO NUMONIUS VALA.

S winter at Velia mild or severe?
Is the sky at Salernum cloudy or clear? '¹‘

And what sort of folk are the people down there?
And, Vala, the roads—say‚ are they pretty fair?
“ Pray, why all these questions?’' I hear you reply.
Bear with me a moment, and you shall know why.

Baiae, Musa† protests, will not do for my case,
And has caused me no little ill-will in the place,
Since under his treatment, come ice or come snow,
I am douehed with cold water from head down to toe :
In truth, the whole town groans, that people no more
Resort to its sweetxmyrtle-groves as of yore,

ἢ* Velia was a town of Lucania. near the mouth of the river Heles
(Alento). The ruins of the town still exist at Casteuamase della Bmoe.
Salemum in Campania was situated at the head of the Gun· of Salerno,
on the heights above the modern town of Salerno. It is about twenty
miles from Velia.

† Musa Antonius. This Epistle was obviously written soon after
Antonius Musa had sprung into notoriety by his successful applioetion
of the cold-water cure to Augustus, whose sreedman he was. μἸἸκε
opposite treatment of hot fomentations aud sweating. applied by the
celebrated physician AEmilius, had entirely failed to reduce the severity
of the attack of gout which seemed to be likely to prove fatal. 'Hie
case was so desperate, that what was regarded as a desperate remedy
seemed to be admissibie. Musa reversed the whole previous treatment.
put Augustus upon a vegetable diet, and applied cold water freely. both
inwardly and in douches. The results were most successful, and although
the health of Augustus was always delimte, he lived thirty-six years
aster his cure. Cold-water baths became the rage. and Baiae, with its
sulphur-springs. which had been to the Romans what Bath and Tun-
bridge used to be to Londoners, fell for a time into disrepute.
