⁸ Upon that dark and wosul bed shall lie,

' Nor ruthless steel nor rugged flint have part.

N otes to tlte odes.

Such lot be mine! Give wealth to him who braves

Disastrous tempests, ocean's angry waveS.

All gold and gems into perdition sweep,

Ere any maid for me asar should weep Σ
Thee well, Messala, it beseems to roam

By land and sea, to bring triumphant home

The spoils of prostrate soemen. Me the chain

Osa sair girl a prisoner doth detain,

And, like a portet, here 1 sit before

The steps os her inexorable door.

Ι care not sor renown‚ my Delia! Stin

Be thou with me, thy heart still let me fill,

And men may eall me dreamer, dotard‚—-what they will ἔ
With thee to yoke my kine were bliss indeed,

Or on the lonely hills my flocks to seed ;

And sleep were sweet upon the hai-dest ground,

If thou within my loving arms wert wound.

What profits it, on Tyrian couch to lie,

If, racked by hopeless love, with tear and sigh

We wake the watches of the night away ?

Not sostest down, nor tapestried array,

Nor flowing streams that gently murmuring creep,

Can o'er us then diffuse the balm of sleep. ¹

The man were iron, who could fly thine arms . ἶ

For lust of plunder, and sor war’s alarms5

Let such before him drive the foe like deer,

And on their conquered soil his war-tents mn -

Let him, ablaze with silver and with gold,

Prance on swift steed‚ for all men to behold;

So I, when dying, see thee near me stand,

And, dying, clasp thee with my falling hand!
Thou wilt bewail me, Delia ; and when 1

Soon to be wrapt in flame, thou'lt give me, dear,
Fond kisses mixed with many a sealding tear ;
Thou wilt bewail me ; in thy gentle beart

From that sad pyre no maiden home shall go,
Nor youth, with eyes that are undimmed by woe.
