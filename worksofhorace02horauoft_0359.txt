Who now reads Naevius? Yet we so revere

Such verse as to our ane-stors was dar.

We quote him like a poet of to-day.*

When solks discuss which bears the palm away,

Pacuvius, of those bards of olden time,

Ranks as more learned, Accius more sublime-i·

Afranius wears his toga, we are told,

Quite in Menander's manner ;1 Plautus old,

Like Epicharmus no dull moment shows,

But hurries on his action to a close:

For weight os thought Caecilius towers apart‚

As Terence shines pre-eminent for ηιξ

These are the men Rome quotes, and holds most deur,

'Tisthese shecramshertheatrestohoer:

These from the days os Livius to our own

She rates as poeta—these, and these alone. v
The popular judgment now and then is sound,

Yet much at fault is on occasion found:

piqued into opposition by hmring him mlled a second Homer.

ings pass into the common speech of the day, though his works are
χ unrcud.

· † Pacuvius, the nephew of Ennius. was born about 13.c. 220. Cicero
places him at the head of Roman tragic writers. Accius, born Rc. 170.
nevas also a great favour-ite with Cicero. who puts him in the first
rank of poets, oelling him “summus poeta,'' Pro Sextio, c. 56, and
again ‘¹ gravis et ingeniosuspoeta.” Ρη) Plane„ c. 24.

ssAfranius, a writer os comic plays, was some yaers younger than
Caecilius and Terence. ‘¹ Comediae wgatoe'· were those of which the in·
cidents and persom were Roman, while the ¹·palliatae·· were Greek in
their· mes and characters. Horace means that Afranius might take
mk with Menander.

5 Nothing by Epicharmus survives, so that there are no means sor
testing the trnth of Horace's comparison. Caeeilius was a comic writer,
older than Terence. His contemporary Cicero ranks him with some
liminatiori as the first of comic writerS, but spmks disparagingly os his
diction. To this objection Terence is not open, and Horace probably
mms to mark by the word ‘¹ art” his excellence both in this respect.

rand also in his management of his characters and soenes.
