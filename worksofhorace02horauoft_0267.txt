HORACE.
Pray, is not a bore,
Tell me, what viand did the rage
orymn- keen stomach first assuage ?

FUNDANIUS.
'T was a Lucanian wild boar, slain,
Our host was careful to explain,
when faintly blew the southern breeze3
With turnips, lemme, radishes,
Around it as a garnish set,
And, jaded appetites to whet,
Sharp skeroeg and anchovy brine,
And with them lees of Coan wine. κ
