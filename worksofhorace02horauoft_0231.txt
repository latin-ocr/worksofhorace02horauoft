But say, great augur, how may 1 amass
Wealth sor my warns, and heaps of minted brass?

TlREsxAs.

I’ve said, and say again: Old men ensnare,
To name you in their testaments as heir.
One here or there, upon his guard, may look
Or nibble at the hait, but shun the hook3

Ι stin be not daunted‚ nor the trade forego..
A case is inthe conns, ofgreat'or no
Importance. Of the parties, find out which
Is without ehick or children, but is rich.
Aroguehemaybe, whohas daredto draw
A better man into the toils of law;
stin take his cause up ; his opponent slight,
Though he have law upon his side, and right,
And is of clear repnte and blameless lise,—
11· he have som, and a prolific wife.
“Quintus or Publius‚” say (a dainty ear
Delights in such distinctions*)‚ “your career
of simple worth has rooted me your friend.
I’m versed in quirks of law, and can defend
A cause with any man. Sooner than you

v Should be one jot defrauded of your due,
To part with mine own eyes I’d rather choose.
Be it my care to see, you neither lose
One saa-thing, nor are made a mark sor jest.”
Then tell him to go home, and be at rest.
