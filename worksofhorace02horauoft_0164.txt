SATIRE V111.

REWHILE I was a fig-trec stock,
A senseless good-sor-nothing block,

When, sorely puzzled which to shape,
A common joint-stool or Priape,
The carpenter his fiat passed,
Deciding sor the god at last.
So god 1 am, to sowl and thies
A source of dread beyond belief. ·
Thieves at my right hand, and the stake
Which from my groin flames menace, quake,
Whilst the reeds waving from my crown
Scare the intrusive birds of town
From these new gardens quite—away,
Where, at no very distant day,
From vilest cribs were corpses brought
In miserable shells to rot.
For 'twas the common burial-ground
Of all the poor for miles around.
Buffoon Pantolabus lay here,
With spendthrift Nomentanus near3
It stretched a thousand feet in span,
A hundred back in depth it ran,—
A pillar marked its boundS‚ and there
Might no man claim the soil as hein*

tombs the letters H. Μ. Η. N .S. :hoc monumentum hoeredem m seqnitur.
