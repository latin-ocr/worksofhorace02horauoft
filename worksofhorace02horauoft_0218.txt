204 Satire III. [ωσι 11.

This to himse10-“ with perfect mse,
Ye gods can do it, if ye please ! '²
In eye and ear, in wind and limb‚
This man was sound, but, selling him,
His master from that warrant would
His mind most certainly exclude,
Unless he loved a lawsuit. Au
This class of people also fau,
So says Chrysippus, to be viewed,
As os the Menenian brotherhood*

“ Ο Jove, who send’st, as thou dost please,
And tak'st away, calamities !”—
Α mother speaks, whose boy has lain
Five months upon a bed of pain,
“ Remove this cruel ague, and
At earliest dawn my boy shall stand
In Tiber, naked, on that day
Thou orderest us to fast and pray.'' ’l'
If chance, or the physieian’s skill
Restore the child, that mother will
Destroy him, set him on the black
Bleak bank, and bring the sever back.
And what the bane has turned her head
To madness thus ?—Religious dread.

These are the arms, 1 have to thank
Stertinius serf—the eighth in rank
Among the sages‚-which he gave me,
From insolent attacks to save rne.

Who calls me mad henceforth, shall get
Well bated with that epithet‚

⁴* Who Menenius was is not known, whose name had this bad
eminenoe in connection with solly. The phrases “Menaiae stnltitiae
vel ineptiae '² are spoken of by Porphyrion as proverbial.

† Most probably Horace here alludes to a Jewish‘fast-day.
