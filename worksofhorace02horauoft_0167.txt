SATIRE IX.

IT chanced that 1, the other day,

When there comes running up a wight‚
Whom only by his name 1 knew;
‘⁸ Ha, my dear fellow, how d'ye do?’'
Grasping my hand, he shouted. “ Why,
As timae go, pretty well‚” said 13 ῃ
“And you, 1 trust, can say the same.''
But after me> as still he came,
“Sir, is there anything,'’ 1 cried,
“You want of me ? ” “ Oh,” he replied‚
“ I'm just the man you ought to know;—
A scholar, author !” “Is it so?

And in my servant’s carlet drop
Some words, and all the while I feel
Bathed in cold sweat from head to beel.
