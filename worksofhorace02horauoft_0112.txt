98 Το Α pollo and Diana.

Our children, goddess, rear in strength and health,
And with thy blessing crown
The Senate's late decree,
The nuptia] law, that of our dearest wealth
The fruitful source shall be,—
A vigorous race, who to posterity
Shall hand our glory‚ and our honours down!
So, as the circling yeam, ten-funes eleven,
Shall bring once more this season round,
Once more our hymns shall sound,
Once more our solemn festival be given,
Through three· glad days, devoted to thy riteS,
Three joyous days, and three not less delightsome nightsl

And you, ye Sister Fames,
Who truly do sulfil
What doom soever, by your breath decreed,
, In the long vista os the future waits,
As ye have ever made our fortunes speed,
Be gracious to us still!

And oh! may Earth, which plenteous increase bears
Os srusts, and corn, and wine,
A stately coronal sor Ceres twine
Of the wheat’s golden shocks,
And healthful waters and salubrious aits
Ι N ourish the yeanling flocks Ξ
Aside thy weapons laid, Apollo, hear
With gracious ear serene
The suppliant youths, who now entreat thy boon Ξ
And thou, of all the constellations queen,
Two-hoened Moon,
To the young maids give ear !
