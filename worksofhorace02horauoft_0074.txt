60 Notes to tlae Odes.

winning. This Epistle also affords a pleasing picture os the friend-
ship os two men who must have had many sympathia· m common.
Ovid, who was a much younger man, and expresses his regret
(Tristia, IV. v. 51) that he only saw virgil. and that Tibullus was
snatched away before he had time to cultivate his friendship, de·
voted one of his elegies to his memory. This poem, besides being
peculiarly beautiful in itself, is valnable sor the biographical hints
which it afl‘ords. It is a curious illustration of the state of manners
to find both the poet's mistresses joining with his mother and sister
in paying the last honours to his remains. Tbere is a dash os grim
irony, too, in the exclamations of the two women, as recorded by
the poet; Delia taunting her successor with the fact that Tibullus
died under the regency of his new passion, and N emesis reminding

Delia of her inconstancy by reference to the fact that it was her ⁴

hand which the dying poet had held within his own,-au allusion
to his own beautifully expressed wish (EL, B. Ι. 1, translated ante, j
p. 56), which must have been peculiarly stinging :- ·

“ If Eos sor her Memnon made lament,
If Thetis wept her son Achilles slain,
If mighty goddesses, like us, are bent
By the rude shocks of anguish and os pain,

Then, wosul Elegy, thy looks unloose,—

Too well henceforth thy name befits thy cheer,—-
Thy darest hard, the glory of thy muse,

A soulless corpse lies smouldering on the bier;

with broken bow, lo 1 yonder Venus' boy,
His quivet void, his lightless torch depressed,
with drooping wings he walks, berest of joy,
And beats with cruel hand his open breasti

Drenched in his tear-s is his dishevelled hair,
With sighs and frequent sobs his bosom rent 3
So from thy home, ’tis said, Iulus sair!
F orth with thy sire AEneas’ bier he went.

Nor for her bard is Venus less distraught

Than when the boar destroyed her love; and yet
We bards the gods’ peculiar care are thought,

And ’mongst their choir of sacred votaries set.
