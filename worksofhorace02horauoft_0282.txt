268 To M oecenas. [noox 1.

Which Curii and Camilli used to sing,

That hail the honest man the only king? .

Who are the best advisers ? Those that say,

“ Get money, money—fairly if you may,

1f not, be sure you get it any way !”

And all to purchase better seats to hear,

When Pupius' twaddling plays satigue the ear ς ‘¹'

Or those who prompt and nerve you to desy

Proud fortune's srowns with calm undaunted eye?
Now should my townsmen ask me, Why do you,

That share our walks, not share our notions too?

Why do you spurn the things we like the best,

And hold so cheap the things that we detest?

Ι answer as did wily Reynard, when

The old sick lion asked him to his den:

“These footprints scare me here along the track‚

All pointing inwards, not one pointing back !'' †

Hydra, besides, has not more heads than you.

XVhom shall I follow, then? What course pursue?

Some kinds of men there are, sor whom to farm

The public taxes has peculiar char-m:

Some who their lures with cakes and apples bait

For thrifty widows with a good estate;

Some catch old men, to suck their purses dry;

By usury some their riches multiply. ,

But pass the fact, that all experience finds

Men’s aims and hobbies various as their minds,

³* Of this Pupius and his works nothing is known. Their lachrymose
character had made them popular for a time, like our own hysteried
tragedies of the last century, or the more recent dramas of the Kotneboe
school; but they had so soon lost their hold on the public, that Quin-
tilian makes no mention of them.

Ἰ· Horace means, by reference to the old AEsopian table, that he
never knew any oue cured of the passion for hoeping up richen. The
miser Alphius of the Second Epode illustratas this belief os the poet in

another way.
