THE SECULAR HYMN.

HOEBUS, and Dian, forest queen,

 
   

“Dp Heaven¹s chiesest light sublime,
. 39⁴3? Ye, who high-worshipped evermore have been,
Ε 3* Ἃ f And shall high-worshipped be for evermore,
Fulfil the prayers which, at this sacred time,
To you we pour 3
This time, when, prompted by the Sibyl's lays,
virgins elect, and spotless youths unite
To the Immortal Gods a hymn to raise
who in the seven-hilled City take delight!

Benignant sun, who with thy car of flame
Bring’st on the day,
And takest it away,
And still are born anew,
Another, yet the same,
In all thy wanderings mayst thou nothing view,
That mightier is than Rome,
The empress of the world, our mother, and our home!
Ο Ilithyia, os our matrons be '
The guardian and the stay,
And, as thine office is, unto the child,
who in the womb hath reached maturity,
Gently unbar the way,
whether Lucina thou wouldst rather be,
Or Genitalis styled!
