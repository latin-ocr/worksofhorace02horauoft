252 satire VII. [noox 11.

DAVUS.
Here's a taking!
The man is mad, ot eISe verse-making! ‘¹'

HORACE.
Be off, or at my faemstead, knave,
You with the other eight shall slave!

ἤ So long as Davus confinae his invective to vices to which Horace
was not inclined, Horace listens with patience. But when he proceeds
to denounce his mastet's love os the good things of the table. his test-
lessness‚ his pronenaes to ennui, he becomes imola-able. Davus, ’
uneonseious how thoroughly home his words have struck. is quite at
aaloss to account for his master's tage, a delicate stroke of humour.
To lose his place as his master's town servant, and to be set to work at
the farm, was a punishment in draed of which he was likely to exetdse
his Saturnalian privileges more sparingly the next December.
