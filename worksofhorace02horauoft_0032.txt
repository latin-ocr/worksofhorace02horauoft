To Μ aecenas. [εΡουε 1x.

Maddened to view this sight of shame,
Two thousand Gauls their horses wheeled‚
And wildly shouting Caesar’s name,
Deserted on the field ;
Whilst‚ steering leftwise o‘er the sea,
The soemen’s broken fleet
Into the sheltering haven flee
In pitiful retreat.

Ho, Triumph ! Wherefore stay ye here
The unbroke steers, the golden cars?

Ho Σ Never brought you back his peer
From the Jugurthine wars !

Nor mightier was the chief revered
Of that old famous time,

Who in the wreck of Carthage reared
His cenotaph sublime ἒ

Vanquished by land and sea, the foe
His regal robes of purple shifts
For miserable weeds of woe,
And o’er the wild waves drists,
Where C'rete arnid the ocean stands
With cities many a score,
Or where o'er Afric‘s whirling sands
The Southern tempests roar.

Come, boy, and ampler goblets erown
With Chian or with Lesbian wine,

Or else our qualmish sickness drown
In Caecuban divine Ξ

Thus let us lull our cares and sighs,
Our fears that will not sleep,

For Caesar, and his great empfise,
In goblets broad and deep ἱ
