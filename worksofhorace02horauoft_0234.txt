⁷ 220 satire V. [noox 11.

Then to his sire-in-law the son shall show

His will, and beg of him to read it. “ No!

No! '’ he replies. But after much ado

He takes the deed, in silence reads it through,

And there he finds‚-conceive with pang how deep 2—
N ought left to him or his, except to weep.

These further counsels let me add. If some
Designing wench, or freedman, ’neath their thumb
Have got a doting fool, with them ally;

Praise them, that they may, when you are not by,
In turn praise you. This helps on greatly. Still,
Work on the man himself with all your skill.

T hat’s best of all. He scribbles songs and lays,
The veriest doggrel ; smother him with praise.
He has a liquorish tooth3 ere he can s‘tate

His wish in words, that wish anticipate‚

And srankly tender your Penelope.

ULYSSES·

Great Powers of Heaven! Do you suppose, that she
Will let herself at his command be placed,

She so discreetly wise, so purely chaste,

Not all the wiles of all the suitors could

Divert her from the paths of rectitude?

TI RES IAS.

Of gifts these youths were niggardly, 1 bean*
Much less on love intent, than lusty cheer;
Discreet‚ too, was your dame as well as chaste.
But once let her some dotard's riches taste‚

⁴* Τὴε gifts which the suitors are mentioned in the Odyssey (xviii. 290
et seq.) as offering to Penelope were somewhat of the shabbiest, a -’
circumstance which probably suggested this passage to Horaoe.
