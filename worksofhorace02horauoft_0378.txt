364 Epz'stle II. [8003 11.

Will, as he writes, in reverence for his art,

Play to himself the honest critic's part ;

Without a pang, if there be words that fail

In force or charm, are colourless and pale,

He casts them off, cling howsoe’er they may

And for a respite from destruction pray.

For our behoof he will drag forth to light

Strong antique words, that paim things to the sight,
Words that old Cato and Cethegus spoke,

But long forgotten by our common folk,

And left neglected in the dust to lie,

That dims and blurs good things of days gone by.
Phrases, so use but father them, he will,

However new to verse, adapt with skill3
Sweeping right onward, clear, and full, and free,
Like some great river swelling to the sea,

He scatters wealth around on every hand,

And glads with copious speech our native land.
No mercy shows he to redundant stuffi

No polish spares on what is harsh or rough.

Cuts what lacks charm or fitness clean away,
And, while he wears a smile as though 'twere play,
Yet will his every nerve be strained and racked,
Like the consummate mime, who has to act

Now Satyr lithe, now lumpish Polypheme,

Yet shows in both an excellence supreme*

'⁶ Pope's lines in his §mitation of this Epistle are worthy to stand by
the original :—·

¹¹ But how severely with themselves proceed
The men who write such verse as we can md?
Their own strict judges, not a word they spate,
'rbat wants or force, or light, or weight, or ease,
Howe'er unwillingly it quits its place.
Nay, though at Court, perhaps, it may find grace:
Such they’ll degrade; and sometimes, in its stad,
In downright charity revive the dead:
