FOUL sall the day, when from the bay
The vessel puts to sea,

'rhat carries Maevius away,
That wretch unsavoury!

Mind, Auster, with appalling rpar
· That you her timbers scourge ;
Black Eurus, snap each rope and oar
With the o’ertoppling surge !

Rise, Aquilo, as when the sar ¹
High mountain-oaks ye rend;

When stern Orion sets, no star
Its friendly lustre lend!

Seethe, ocean, as when Pallas turned
Her wrath from blazing Troy

On impious Ajax’s bark‚ and spumed
Τὶιε victors in their joy!

1 see them now, your wretched crew,
All toiling might and main,

And you, with blue and death-like hue,
Imploring Jove in vain !

‘⁴ Mercy, oh, mercy! Spare me ! Pray! ”
With craven moan ye cau,

When founders in the Ionian bay
Your bark before the squall:
