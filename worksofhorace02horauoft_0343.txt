Osany gre-1 man's household set your hart.
Lat under obligatior: by so small
Agisthelayyou. or, refusing, gall.

Be very merul whom you recommend
To the attention os a powefful friend.

Lat haply some discredit should be thrown

On you sor sins and [ailings not your own.

We introduce, ourselves misled before,

Some quite unworthy person: all the more

should we. when his demetits are revealed,

0⁸ er him who played us false not cast our shield,

So that. should slander launch her venomed
dans

Atoneyou knowdowntohishoest osb-ans.

Yon may with more effect uphold his name,

Whotruststoyou tovindieate his same.

For, be asured, the mlumny that drew

Her shafts at him has some in stote sor you:

With the next house in flames, best look ahad——

A fite neglected's pretty sure to spread.

'rin time has made us wisc, 'tis sweet to wait
Upon the smiles and favour of the grean
But he that once has ventur-ed that career
Shrinlrs from its perils with instinctive sear.
You, while your bark drivoe gaily on her nack,
Beware of squalls may take you all aback.

Τὴο grave the gay. the sad the joyous hate,
Sluggasds the active, gauiards the sedate.
Topers, that sit till midnight o'er their wine,

If you to eope them glass for glas decline,
Haxe you, however you may ploed your dread
Of a hot skin at night, and racking head.
Uncloud your brow: the modest ost appear
Deep to design, the silent prone to sneer.
