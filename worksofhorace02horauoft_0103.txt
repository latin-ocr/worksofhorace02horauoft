Sextus Pompeius, who was defeated in B.c. 36 by Agrippa off Mylae,
and again off Naulochns, in the Siciliain See. He had taken into
his service all the slaves who fied to him. The ‘¹ womtn's slave ’' of

E'ronn XL, page 20.

This amusing picture of a· disconsolate lover is obviously an early
poem, and founded upon fact. Who the lady was whose neglect ‚
had thrown the poet into the state of wne-begone dismetion which
he so graphically describes is uncertain, and is indeed of no great
moment. The chaneos are that she was the bona Cinara os Ode
xiii. Β. 1v.

Cinam, whoever she was, seems to have been Horace’s first love,
andherimnge dungabout his henrt till latein life. He had the
additional motive sor loving het memory that she died young
(odet, xiii. B. IV.) He, too, had said,—who has it not to say?
-—“Das ist das loos-da Sche‘inen ausder Erde!” How manya
day-dmm may she not have filled sor the poet with a sad benum,
among the solitudes of his Sabine valley!

The Roman lover in despair was quite as apt as his modern
counterpnrt to seek consolation in the wine-cup. Thus Tibullus

(meg. Ῑν5) ²-

“ QmMmrasWMedm;
At dolor in lacrymas verteraiomne merum ; '’

where the remedy and the results aie precisely those which the
bnllad-mongen with more truth than grace, records in the familiar
quatrainz—

“TowineIflewtoeasethepain
Her beauteous charms created 3
But wine more fmnly bound the chain,
And love would not be cheated.”

Horace’s complaint that geniushas no chance with beauty when
matched against wealth is v'ery·amnsineg put. The cry has been
transmitted by all sotts os poets to our own times, through every
modulationi of tone, frotn flippant sarcusm to wild despair. It ω
nn old one,- donbtless, in the days of Anacreon, who thus states the
poorlover’s cnse with all the emphasis of strong personal seelings :—
