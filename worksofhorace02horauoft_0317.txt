To him that’s truly well. what are at best
Your Rhodes. your Mitylene, and the rest ἶ
To him they are just such a kind os boon
As a weu-quilted overooat in June.

Short dravers in winter, Tiber when it sleets,
Or a brisk fite in August’s sultry hats.

While balth and sate, then, let me stay at home.
At home 1 mm to stay, and, snug in Rome.
Praise Chios, Samos, Rhodes, as passing sair,

So you insist not on my going there.

Do you, lone wanden-er in a distant land,
Take the glad hours stom heaven with grateful hand,-
Take and enjoy them as they come, nor stay
To taste enjoyment till some far-off day.

So. wheresoe’er you've been, you may deelare
Yon lived a life was quite worth living there.
For ir nanquillity of soul be due

To plain good sensefnot to a grand sea-view,
However sar o'er oeoen we may range,

'ris but the climate, not the mind, we change.
Yet! ever-busy idlers that we are,

⁸ We seek and seek sor bliss with ship and car.

1 The thing we seek is here. Be but your mind
, Well poised‚ that bliss at Ulubrae* you’ll find.
