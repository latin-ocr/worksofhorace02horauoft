Next morning Philip searches Mena out,
And finds him vending to a rabble rout
Old crazy lumber, srippery of the worst, ’
And with all courtesy salutes him first.
Mena pleads occupation, ties of trade,
His service else he would by dawn have paid
At Philip’s house‚-—was grieved to think, that how
He should have sailed to notice him till now.
“On one condition I accept your plea,
You come this asternoon, and dine with me.''
“ Yours to command.'¹ “ Be there, then, sharp at four!
Now go, work hard, and make your little more !”
At dinner Mena rattled on, expressed
Whate’er came uppermost, then home to rest.
The hook was baited crastily, and when
The fish came nibbling ever and again,
At morn a client,and, when asked to dine,
Not now at all in humour to decline.
Philip himself one holiday drove him down,
To see his villa some few miles from town.
Mena keeps praising up, the whole way there,
The Sabine country and the Sabine air:
So Philip sees his fish is fairly caught,
And smiles with inward triumph at the thought.
Resolved at any price to have his whim,—-
For that is best of all repose to him,—
Seven hundred pounds he gives him there and then,
Proffers on easy terms as much again,
And so persuades him, that, with tastes like his,
He ought to buy a farm ;—so bought it is.
Not to detain you longer than enough,
The dapper cit becomes a sarmer bluff,
Talks drains and subsoils, ever on the strain
Grows lean‚ and ages with the lust of gain.
