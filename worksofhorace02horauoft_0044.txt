Canidia’s Reply. [amna xvn.

Then drive, for so thou canst, this pain,

This 'wildering frenzy from my hrain!
O thou, untainted by the guile

Os parentage depraved and vile,

Thou, who dost ne'er in haglike κνοω,

Among the tombs of paupers hunt

For ashes newly laid in ground,

Love-charms and philtres to compotum,

Thy heart is gentle, pure thy hjtnds;

And there thy Partumeius stands,

Reproof to all, who dare presume

With barrenness to charge thy womb ;

For never dame more sprightly rose

Or lustier from child-bed throes!

CANIDIA'S REPLY.

WHY pour your prayers to heedless ears?
Not rocks, when Winter’s blast career&

Lashed by the angry surs, are more

Deaf to the seaman dashed on shore Ξ

What ! Think‚ unpunjshed, to deride,

And rudely rend the veil aside‚

That shrouds Cotytto’s murky rites‚ ,

And love's, unfettered lovels, delights?

And, as though you high priest might be

“ Of Esquilinian sorcery, .

Branding my name with ill renown,
Make me the talk of all the town?
Where then my gain, that with my gold
1 bribed Pelignian beldames old,

Or mastered, by their aid, the gift

To mingle poisons sure and swift?
