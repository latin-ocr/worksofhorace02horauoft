visit Greece. The allusions to the evil omens remind ns with what
tenacity superstition clings to the human mind, when we see that
neither revelation nor science-has yet extinguished the belief in
many of those to which Horace refers. The transition to the story
of Europa is abrupt according to our notions ς but a reference to
this triumphant beanty’s troubles and glory was an implicit com-
pliment to the beanty and attractions of Galatea.

This Ode will probably always be read in English in Dryden’s
noble version, which, as a whole, is certainly finer than the originaL‘
The following passage, of which a saint suggestion only is to be
found in Horace, is highly characteristic of the genius of Dryden,
and his peculiar mastery of the great rhythmica] resouroes of our
language :—

“ Happy the man, and happy he alone,
He, who oen call to-day his own3
He, who, secure within, can say,
To·morrow do thy worst, sor 1 have lived to-day.
Be sair, or foul, or rain, or shine,
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.
Not heaven itself upon the past has power;
But what has been, has been, and 1 have had my honr.
Fortune, that with malicious joy
Dooe man her slave oppreSS,
Proud of her office to destroy,
Is seldom ploesed to bless:
Still various, and unconstant still,
But with an inclination to be ill,
Promotes, degrades, delights in strise,
And makes a lottery os lise.
Ι can enjoy her while she’s kind 3
But when she dances in the wind,
And shakes her wings, and will not stay,
1 puff the prostitute away;
The little or the much she gave is quietly resigned ;
Content with poverty my soul 1 arm 3
And virtue, though in ragS, will keep me warm.”
