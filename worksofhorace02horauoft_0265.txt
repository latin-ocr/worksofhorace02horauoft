Yon ask, how so? Bemuse, ahck,

Yet, aster ²11, do youmppose
You pay no penalty for those
choioe meam, that have such charms foryou?
Paid sm· they must be, doerly too;

In time the source ofbitter νοω,
And the enfeebled feet tesuse
To bear the trunk you so ill use.
Is the poor slave a culm-it, who
At nightsall barters, for a few
Clustexs of gmpes, the brush he stole?

⁷ Who melts his aeres down, and all
To gmtify his stomaeh’s call ἓ

Loeve you an hour alone, and you

A listloes lounging fugitive,
still striving, care at bay to keep,
Now with the wine-cup, now with sleep.
Vain hope! For fly howe’er you win,
That gloomy comrade dogs you still.

HORACF.
Oh, for a quiver!
