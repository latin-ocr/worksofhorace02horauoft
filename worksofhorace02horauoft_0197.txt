»σοι 11.l satire II. 1 83

wmelenfnll this grat hap have you nothing to spate
For our dea: native land? Or why should you dare
Tothinkthatmisfortnnewillnever o'ertake you?
oh, then what a butt would your enemies make you!
Who willbeut meet merses? The man who, yon find,
Has bylmrioe pampered both body and mind?
Or he who, eontented with little, and still
Imkhgonwthefirmrgandfearfixlofill,

Ἴ Long,longereamurmurisheardsromafar
In pace has laid up the munitione. os war?

To make these views carry more eredit with you,
when myselfa small boy, this Ofeutis 1 knew,
Though walthy, yet no whit less frugal in all
Thannowhislasgemoensarecut down into small.
Now only a tenant, he works a small farm
with a hart still as stout, and as stalwart an arm,
And there, while his cattle are brev-ming, and near him
His children at work, any day you may hear him
Discourse to them thus ε “1 was not such a scol,

In those dayS, to eat anything else, as a rule,

Thau, pulse and a'bit of smoked pig’s foot. But then,
If a long—absent friend came to see me again,

Or a neighbour dropped in of a day, when the wet
Stopped all work out of doors, they were handsomely met,
Not with fish from the town, but with pullet and kid,
With a good bunch of grapes for dessert‚ laid amid

A handful os nuts, and some figs of the best.

Then we drank, each as much as he felt had a zest;
And Ceres, to whom our libations were poured,

That our crops might be good, and in safety be stored,
Relaxed with the mirth of our simple carouse

The wrinkles that care had dug into our brows.

“ should Fortune set madly fresh troubles abroach‚
How much on what’s left to us can she encroach?
