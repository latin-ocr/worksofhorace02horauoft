362 Epz‘stle II. [Boox 1¹.

Go now, my friend, and meditate at ease
Mellifluous verse ’mid incidents like these.

No, no Ξ We minions of the Muse were made
To fly from towns and court the greenwood glade,
True votaries of the Bacchus, whose delight
Is in soft sleep, and woodland’s mellow night3
Yet 'midst a roar that ebbs not night nor day
You ask of me to modulate my lay,

And in the track of mighty poets climb

The narrow path that leads to heights sublime.

In empty Athens, when a man who's spent

Seven years in study, o’er great authors beat,

More stock—dumb than a statue, wanders out,

As such men will, the crowd with laughter shout.⁴¹·
ι And shall poor 1, here tossed upon the waves

Of busy life, that round me roars and raves,

Shall I to marry thoughts to words aspire,

Can wake the soul that slumbers in the lyre ?

A jurist and a pleader, brothers two,

Each here at Rome the other’s trumpet bsew5
A very Gracchus this, a Mutius that !

So each cried up the other, tit for tat.

We sons of song, in these degenerate dayS‚
Are we not bitten by the sels-same craze?

Ι scn‘bble odes—he elegies. “Divine!

The Muses’ fingers felt in every line ! ”

Mark‚ too, the strut, the sels-complacent air,
The eyes in a fine frenzy, as we stare

’θ Paraphrased by Pope:—
“ The man who, stretched in Isis· oelm retreat,

To books and study givos seven years complete,
See, strewed with dust, his loerned nightcap on,
He walks an object new benaeth the sun!
The boys flock round him, and the people stare:
So stiff, so mute! Some statue, you would swmr,
Stept from its pedestal to take the air ! '¹
