2 12 Satire IV. [mox 11.

Wine of Surrentum ¹¹· if you would
Mix with Falernian leeS, you should
Employ the yolks of pigeon's eggs,
Which best precipitate the dregs.

· After a deep carousal, when
You're hypped, to set you up again,
To shrimps commend me, grilled with toast,
And snails fetchedsssrom the Afric coast.
For lettuces on wine, take note,

In the fermenting stomach float,
Whose queasy motion to appease
Ham is the thing, and sausage5‚
Or any trash, high-spiced and hot,
Which can in cookshop foul be got.

Your labour amply ’twill requite,
of sauces, which are composite,
The nature thoroughly to know.

A plain sort is compounded so:
Sweet oil, with syrup wine combined,
And tunny-pickle, of the kind

’ Which has to due putrescence come
In pipkins of Byzantium.
Boil up with this, if you incline
To something richer, herbs cut fine,
Sprinkle with Coryc saffron, and,
Till it has settled, let it stand, .
Then finish off with oil, the best,
From berry of Venafrum † pressed.

  
  
   
  

¹* Sor-rento. which continues to produce a light wine of fair quality.

-Ι- The modern Venafro, on the road from ‘remi to Naploe, was ·
obviously in high repnte t'or the excellence os its olives. Horace (Odet,
11. 6-20) can give no higher praise to those of his favouxite Tibur than
that they were quite equal to those of Venafrum. Tibur stin retains iu*
character iu this respect, it· we may judge from thevigom· and · ν· ·
of its olive grows. The slopefl at Venafro are to this hour covered “ ·
the same profitable but not pictur-esque timber.
