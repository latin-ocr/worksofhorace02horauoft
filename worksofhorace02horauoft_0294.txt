EPISTLE V.
το MANLms TORQUATUS.

F you on couches can recline
Of common timber when you dine,

And have no sear of homely sare
Served up on plainest earthenware,
At set os sun I’ll hope to see
You here, good Manlius, with me*
The wine that you shall drink was grown
’Twixt dank Minturnae and the cone*
of steep Petrinus, and can date
Beyond even Taurus' consulate-*1¹

ὕ Of Manlius Torquatus nothing is known beyond what this Epistle
tells us. He is no doubt the same valued friend to whom the Seventh
Ode of the Fourth Book is addressed. The Epistle is delightful for the
glimpses it gives us of Horace's unpretending house, and of his condial
relations with his friends. Torquatus. the busy lawyer. is asked to a
late dinner of plain sane and hemely wine. which is to have its best
relish from the genial oompanionship os the trusty circle of friends who
will share thern with him. They may sit late, for the next day being a
holiday,—whetherJ ulius or Augustus Caesar's birthday, the commentatum
have not agreed—we should say the former, as it fell in July, while that
of Augustus was in September, a month when Horaoe’s tegani for his

health would have kept him out of Rome, if he oould by any umus be , .'

absent‚—there was no necessity for getting up early to see cliente or
transact business.

ἦ· Petrinus was a tract of land overhaugiug Sinuessa-Minturnae
stood upon the marshy land flooded by the Lirio (Garigliano); and
although the famous Falernian and Massie vineyards were not far off,
it is very obvious that the wine promised by Horace to his friends had
no pretensions to rank with either of these famous growths. ¹ ’
