EPODE V.
THE WITCHES' ORGY.

“ WHAT, O ye gods, who from the sky
Rule earth and human desfiny,
What means this coil? And wherefore be
These *cruel looks all bent on me?

Thee by thy children Ῑ conjure,

If at their birth Lucina pure .
Stood by ; thee by this vain array

Of purple, thee by Jove I pray,

Who views with anger deeds so foul,
Why thus on me like stepdame scowl,
Or like some wild beast, that doth glare
Upon the hunter from its lair?²'

As thus the boy in wild distress‚
Bewailed‚ of bulla stripped and dress,—
So fair, that ruthless breasts of Thrace
Had melted to behold his face,—
Canidia, with dishevelled hair,

And short crisp vipers coiling there,

Beside a fire of Colchos stands,

And her attendant hags commands,

To seed the flames with fig-trees tom

From dead men’s sepulchres sorlorn,

With dismal cypreSS‚ eggs rubbed o’er

With filthy toads' envenomed gore,

With screech-owls' plumes, and herbs of bane,
From far Iolchos setched and Spain,
