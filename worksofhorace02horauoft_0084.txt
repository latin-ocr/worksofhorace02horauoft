Tm: Pindaric verse, introduced by Cowley, and carried by
Dryden to perfection, has been adopted in translatiug this Ode, the
14th Ode of the Fourth Book, and the Secular Hymn, as the oniy

measure in which the requisite sreedom of movement could be

obtained for grappling with the originals. This verse, ‘whilst in

some respects it tempts to amplification, is favourable to closenoes
in others, inasmuch as the translator is not tied down, as in our

ordinary stuza, to a regularly recurring rhyme. Dryden, with his ’

usual mastery of critical exposition, has said all that can be said

of this noble form of verse. “ For variety, or rather where the, '

majesty of thought requires it, the numbers may be stretched to
the English heroic of five feet, and to the French Alexandrine of
six. ., But the ear must preside, and direct the judgment to the

choiee of numbers. without the nieety of this the harmony' of ’

Pindaric verse ean never be complete 3 the cadency osone line must

be a rule to that of the next ; and the sound eff the former must slide ·

gently into that which follows, without Ieaping from one extreme into
another. It must be done like the shadowings of a picture, which

fall by degrees into a darker colour.'’

The defeat of the Romans under Crassus (3.6. 53), by the Par- '
thians, was one of the most signal disgraces ever sustained by the* ,
Roman arms. Their standards fell into the hands os the enemy,
and many of the Roman prisoners had accepted their fate, married
Parthian women, aud become the subjects of a Parthian king.
