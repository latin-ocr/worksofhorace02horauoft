48 Notes to the Odes.

But Love, when lovers into quarrels stray,
Prompts words of venom to embroil the stay,
And as from each to each the missiles fly,

He sits unmoved and inly smiling by.

The man who strikes a girl is steel‚ is stone,
And drags the gods down from their skyey none.

son amant3 mais rien ne lasse si vite que les larmes‚—fussentelle Α

les perles.'’—(‘ Le Violon de F ranjole'.’) M. Emaet Feydenu, in the
most shamelessly unmanly book of his day (‘ Fanny’),—it has been
eclipsed by others more unmanly §nez—represents his hero ns
striking his mistress, a lady of rank superior to his own, without a.

misgiving thatin this he is doing anything extraordinary. ‘⁸ Ene .
