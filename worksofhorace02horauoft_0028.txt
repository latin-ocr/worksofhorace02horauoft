T 0 Cassius Severus. [mont v1.··

Pelt you from street to street with stenes,
Till falling dead, ye filthy crones,
The dogs and wolves, and carrion fowl, ’

. That make on Esquiline their prom,

In banquet horrible and grim

Shall tear your bodies limb from limb.
Nor shall my parents fail to see

That sight‚-—alas, surviving me l ⁷'

 

EPODE VI.
'ro CAssms SEVERUS.

s ILE cur, why will you late and soon
At honest people fly? ’
You, you, the veriest poltroon
Whene'er a wolf comes by Σ

Come on, and if your stomach be
So ravenous sor sight,

I'm ready ! Try your teeth on me,
You’ll find that 1 can bite. ,

For like Molossian mastiff stout‚
Or dun Laconian hound,

That keeps sure ward, and sharp look-out
For all the sheepfolds round,

Through dristed snows with ears thrown back,
I’m ready, night or day,

To follow fearless on the track
Of every beast of prey.
