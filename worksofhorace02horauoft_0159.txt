Across his flanks, which, flapping as we go,

With my ungainly ankloe to and fro,

Work his unhappy sides a world os weary woe.

Yet who shall call me mean, as men call you,

On the Tiburtine Way with five poor knaves,

Half-grown, half-starved, and overweighted slaves,

Bearing, to save your charges when you dine,

A travelling kitchen‚ and a jar of wine ?
mustrious senator, more happy far,

1 live than you, and hosts of others are!

1 walk alone, by mine own fancy led,

Inquire the price of potherbs' and of bread,

The circus cross to see its tricks and fun,

ne sorum, too, at times near set of sun;

With other sools there do 1 stand and gape

q Round fortune-tener& stans, thence home escape

To a plain meal of pancakes‚ pulse, and peas;

Three young boy-slaves attend on me with these

Upon a slab of snow-white marble stand

A goblet, and two beakers; near at hand,

A common ewer, patera, and bova,—

Campania’s potteries produced the whole.

To sleep then 1, unharassed by the sear

Without a paug the Younger Novius' look.
