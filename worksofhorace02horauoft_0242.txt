228 . Satira VI. [noox 11.

And bacon, not too sat, embellish
My dish of greens, and give it relish?
Oh happy nights, oh feasts divine,
When, with the friends 1 love, 1 dine
At mine own hearth—fire, and the meat
We leave gives my bluff hinds a treat!
No stupid laws our feasts control,

. But each guest drains or leaves the bowl,
Precisely as he feels inclined.
Is he be strong, and have a mind
For bumpers, good! if not, he’s free
To sip his liquor leisurely.
And then the talk our banquet rouses!
Not gossip 'bout our neighbours' houses,
Or if ’tis generally thought
That Lepos dances well or not ,Ν-

s But what concerns us nearer, and
Is harmsul not to understand,
Whether, by wealth or worth, ’tis plain,
That men to happiness attain?
By what we’re led to choose om· friends,—
Regard for them, or our own ends?
In what does good consist‚ and what
Is the supremest form of that? s· ’

And then friend Cervius will strike in

With some old grandam’s tale, akin
To what we are discussing. Thus,
If some one have cried up to us

ἃ How like is this to T ennyson's—

“ You’ll have no soendal while you dine,
But honest talk and wholesome wine.
And only hear the magpie gossip
Garmlous, under a roos of pine.''
