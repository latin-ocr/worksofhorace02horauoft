SATIRE vl.

M Y prayers with this 1 used to charge,—
A piece of land not over large,
Wherein there should a garden be,
A clear spring flowing ceaselessly,
And wheoe, to cmm the whole} there should
A patch be found of growing wood-
All this, and more, the gods have sent,
And 1 am heartily content*
Ο son of Maia, that 1 may
These bounties keep is all 1 pray.†
If ne'er by craft or base design
I’ve swelled what little stote is mine,
Nor mean it ever shall be wrecked
By profligacy or neglect ς
Is never from my lips a word
Shall drop of wishes so absurd
As, “ Had 1 but that little nook,
Next to my land, that spoils its look! ’²
Or, ‘⁴ Would some lucky chance unfold
A crock to me of hidden gold,
As to the man, whom Hercules
Enriched and settled at his ease,
