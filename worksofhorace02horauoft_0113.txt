 

To Apollo and Diana. '99

n· Rome be all thy work, if Trojan bands υ
Upon the Etruscan shore have won renown,
That chosen temnant, who at thy commands
Forsook their hearths, and homes, and native town;
Isau unscathed through Ilion’s flames they sped
By sage AEneas led,
And o'er the ocean-waves in safety ssed,
Destined from him, though of his home berest,
A nobler dower to take, than all that they had left!

Ye powers divine,
Unto our docile youth give morals pure !
Α Ye powers divine,
To placid age give peace,
And to the stock of Romulus ensure
Dominion vast, a neverssfailing line,
And in all noble things still make them to increase!

And oh! may he who now
To you with milk—white steers uplists his prayer,
Within whose veins doth flow
Renowned Anchises’ blood, and Venus' ever sair,
Be still in war supreme, yet still the soe
His sword hath humbled spare !
Now, even now the Mede
Our hosts omnipotent by land and sea,
And Alban axes fears3 the Scythiam, late
So vaunting, and the hordes of Ind await‚
On low expectant knee,
What terms soe'er we may be minded to concede.
Now Faith, and Peace, and Honour, and the old
Primeval Shame, and Worth long held in scorn,
To reappear make bold,
And blissful Plenty, with her teeming horn,
Doth all her smiles unfold.
