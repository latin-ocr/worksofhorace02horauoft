When the first pleasure of identifying the familiar features of the
poet’s description has somewhat abated‚ one naturally thinks of the
animated dialogue between his bailiff Davus and himself (Satires, 11.
7), and his Epistle to Davus, the fourteenth of the F irst Book.
If Davus tired of the country, it is no less certain that his master
found it grow rather dull at times. Ροοι· Davus 1 it must have been
dull indeed to him, for he had no “libri veterum,” as his master
had, to sall back upon for amusement. Neither wa there any town
nearer than Mandela, good three miles off, no “ uncta popina '’-the
counterpart of the grimy, greasy osterias, which the Davi of the
present day seem to find so attractive-where he could enjoy rough
jokes over his wine with the ‘ ‘ meretrix tibicina '' of the tavern. And
the work of littering down oxen, and building dms against refrac-
tory brooks, is neither pleasant nor easy work to a servant aecustomed

to the habits of a luxurious city. No doubt the novelty of the scene j

made the change pleasant enough for a time, but we eannot wonder

that aster a few weeks of rough living and lonelinaes he began to
hanker aster the “ludos} et balnea '⁷ of town, and to wonder what “

charm his master could find in what seemed to him “deserta et
inhospita tesqua.'' ’

It is all very well sor Horace to ask his bailiff whether he ever ,
saw him leave the place without regret, when he was called away -

to Rome by “invisa negotia ” at times when he did not want to go
there. But he himself lets out the admission that it was not always

with a grudge that he went back to the capital. At Rome belonged ' Ῑ

for the country, in the country he longed sor Rome. Davus kne'w

this very well, and Horace knew that he knew it. Accordingly he ¹ ’

makes him say as much in the Seventh Satire of the Second Book,

when that sagacious and sharp-tongued varlet elaims and is allowed

a Saturnalian lieence of speech :—

“ Roma rus optas, absentem mixtus urbem
Tolli-r ad astra levir.”

“ At Rome you for the country sigh :
When in the country to the sky
You, ssighty as the thistle’s down,
Are always crying up the town.”

Nay, his master’s praise of plain dinners‚ and professed delight at
esoeping from the necessity of drinking as many cups of wine as '-
the master of the feast might dictate, on which he had expatiated ·

so earnestly in the immediately preceding satire (ΙΙ. 6), Davus tells
