Yet sared the while. it might be thought 1 reigned
Too low what influenee 1 pel-chance have gained ;
Dissembling it ις nothing with my friends,

To keep it sor my own peculiar ends

So to escape such dread reproach, 1 put

My blushes by, aud boldly urge my suit.

If. then. you hold it as a grace, though small.

To doff one’s bashfuluess at friendship's mll,
Enrol him in your suite, assured you’ll find

A man of heart in him. as well as mind.

EPISTLE X.
το Fuscus Amsrms·

Fuscus. our most city-leving friend.

We, lovers os the country, greeting send.-'
We, whom in this most diverse views divide,
Though wellnigh twins in everything beside.
True mental brothers we—what one denies,
The other questions and in sels—same wise
Are we in sancies one, in tastes, in loves.
As any pair of year-long mated doves.
You keep the nest; 1 love the country brooks.
Τὴε rums-grown rocks. and shady woodland nooks.
And why? Because 1 live and am a king,
The moment 1 ean sar behind me fling
What you extol with rapture to the skiae ;
And. like the slave that from the temple flies,
Beoeuse on swa-calm he is daily sed,
So 1. a simple soul. lack simple broad,
With honeyed dainties palled and surfeited.
