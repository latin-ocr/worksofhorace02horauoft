300 To Fuscus Aristius. [noox 1.

to Wordsworth (3oth Jan. 1801): ‘⁸ Separate from the phasur-e of your
company, 1 don't much mre if 1 never see a mountain in my life. Ι
have passed all my days in london. until 1 have formed as many and
intense local attachments π any os you mountaineexs ean have done
with dead nature. The lighted shops of the strand and Fleet street ;
the innumerable trades, tradesmen. and customens, eoaehoe. waggons,
playhouses; au the busue and wickedness round Covent Garden, . . .
life awake, if you awake, at all hours of the nightg the impossibility of
being dull in Fleet Street3 the crowds, the very >‹lirt and mud, the sun
shining upon houses and pavements. the print-shops. the old book-
stans, pensons cheapening books, coffee·housoe, stoems of soup from
kitchens, the pantomimes—London itself a pantomime and a masquer·
ade, -all these things work themselves into my mind and soed me with·
out a power of satiating me. The wonder of these sights impels me
into night walks about her crowded sueets. and Ι often shed tems in
the motley Strand from fulness of joy at so much life.”

When he wrote this. Lamb had never seen a mountain. Soon after,
he visited Wordsworth at Rydal Mount5 but he stin remained of the
same mind. On the 24th of September 1802, he writes to his friend
Manning: “After all, Fleet Street and the Strand are better places to
live in sor good and all, than amidst Skiddaw. Stin 1 tum back to
those great places, where I wandered about participating in their gumt-
ness. After all, 1 could not live in Skiddaw. 1 oould spend a. year,
two, three years among them, but 1 must have a prospect of seeing
Fleet Street at the end of that time. or Ι should mope and piae away, 1
know. still, Skiddaw is a fine creature-'¹
