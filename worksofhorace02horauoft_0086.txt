Τὸ Lyce.

This lady has been assumed to be one of Horaee’s many mis-
tresses, upon what appear to be very insufficient grounds. The

presents to that in Lydia Languish's confession to her friend Julia!
“How mortisying to remember the deur delicious shists one used
to be put to, to gain half a minute’s conversation with this sellowl
