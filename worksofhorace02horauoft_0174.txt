doubt. Of the actual rond over which the feet of 'Horace and his
contemporaries passed nothing appears· to be lest, with the excep-
tion, possibly, οἱ a small portion on the rise of the Capitoline Hill
between the Arch of Septimius Severus, or, more accuratdy, between
the remains of the Rostra and those os the Temple οἱ satum. But
the line of the road is clearly marked as running between the
Basilica Julia and the remains which have now been uncovered
of the pedestals on which a series of statues mnst at some time
have been erected, and thence sweeping with a sharp enrve
first to the right and then to the lest round the Temple of Saturn
up the Sacer Clivus to the Capitol. Standing by the circula· heap
of concrete which marks the site of the Temple of Vesta, and
looking towards the Capitol, a vivid meaning is infnsed into the
words of Horace, Odes, Book 111. 30, 1. 7 :—

‘¹ Usque ego postera
Cresca m laude recens, dum Capitolium
Scandet cum tacita virgine Pontifex!

‘⁶ For long as with his Vestals mute
Rome's Pontifex shall elimb

The Capitol, my fame shall shoot
Fresh buds through future time.'’

We feel that it was along this line that the stately processions,
religious or triumphal‚ passed, at all events until the later period,
when, aster the Arch of Septimius Severus was constructed, they
might have been diverted through that arch, and along the rond, of
which the remains may now be seen, which skirted the eastern side
of the Forum.

These topographical details, verified by a recent caresnl stndy
on the spot, are not without importance to a right understanding
of the present Satire. Where did Horace meet the bore, andwas

he coming up or down the Forum when he met him? Scareely ,

down the Forum from the Capitol, sor the distance that would

have been traversed was too short sor what occurred. More· ’

over, in that mse Horace could scarcely have' pretended, as he
did, that he was on his way to see a sick friend beyond Caesar’s
gardens on the other side of the Tiber. To do this he would
not have descended into the Forum, but have made his way south-

west from the Capitoline Hill towards the Sublician Bridge3 while ,
coming the other way towards the Forum, he might be supposed to g

intend to turn aside out oi' the Forum into the Vicus TuscuS, close
to the Basilica Julia. in order to get to that bridge.
