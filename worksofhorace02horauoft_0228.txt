214 Satire I V. [noox 11.

HORACE.
O learned CatiuS, prithee‚ by
Our ffiendship, by the Gods on high,
Take me along with you, to hear
Such wisdom‚ be it sar or near!
For though you tell me all—in fact,
Your memory is most exact—-
Still there must be some grace of speech
Which no interpreter can reach.
The look, too, of the man, the mien!
Which you—what fortune t—having seen,
May for that very reason deern
Of no account3 but to the stream,
Even at its very sonutam-head,
I fain would have my footsteps led,
That, stooping, 1 may drink my fill,
Where such life-giving saws distil.
