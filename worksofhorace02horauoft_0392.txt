The landlocked port, a work well worthy kings,

That takes whole fleets within its sheltering wings ; '⁶

Swamps, sterile long, all plashy, rank, and drear,

Groan ’neath the plough, and seed whole cities near;

The river, perilous to field and farm,

Its channel changed, can now no longer harm,†—

These, and all earthly works‚ must pass away:

And words, shall they enjoy a longer day?

Some will revive that we no more allow,

And some die out that are in favour now,

1f usage wills it so, for ’tis with her

The laws of language rest as sovereign arbiter¹¹
Homer has shown what measure fitliest sings

The seats and rueful wars of chiefs and kings.
Sad Elegy, at first all sighs and tears,

Sang, later on, of lovers' joys and fears.

Grammarians differ, who first taught its strains,—

An old dispute, that still unsolved remains.
Archilochus found for his sury’s heat

A vent in the Iambus’ rapid beat ; Ι

The sock and stately buskin took to it,

As sor the play of dialogue most fit,

θ’ Regis opus. So Pope, “These are imperial works‚ and worthy
kings.'' What Horace here alludes to is the portus Julius. This was
a magnificent harbour formed by the junction of the Lacus Lucrinus
with the Lacus Avernus, and a channel cut through the tongue of land
which separated the former from the sea. Following the advice of
Agrippa, Augustus carried out this work, which gave in Lake Avernus
a harbour more than a mile and a half in cirmunfeoenoe. Here he
exercised his fleet, Suetonius mentions (Aug. 16), for a whole winter,
with such good effect, that he was able to defeat his fonnidable adver·
sary Sextus Pompeius, when he encountered him between Mylae and
Naulochus. The canals and the piers at the entrance from thesea
were in existence at the beginning of the 16th century, but were de-
stroyed by an eruption of Monte Nuova, 29th September 1538.

† Supposed to allude to some plans by Augustus for draining the
Pomptine Marshes, which were never carried out, and for altering the
course os the Tiber.
