The Art ofPoetty. 389

My diction should be plain. familiar. quite

What any man might fancy he could write,

But. having tried and toiled with might and main
ln hopes to reach, would find his efforts vain.
Such power have words set subtly in their place,
‘rhat even familiar things acquire a grace.

But have a mre—at* loest 1 think you should,—
Your Fauns. those denizens os rock and wood.
Minoe not their verses with a town-bred air,

Like the young sops that lounge in street or square.
Nor hiceup out with all-unseemly soree

Their jests in phrase indelicate and coarse.

For though their clownish ribaldry may ploese
The purchasers οἱ nuts and roasted ραι-ς’

All that have horsoe, fathers. or good mans.
Detoet and are revolted by such soenes.

Two syllables. one short and soremost put.
Compose the iambus: and so swist its feet,
Iamhics are called trimeters, although
Six several δαῖε ἰιι every line they show.

At first these all ran even: but os late,

To give the lines more emphasis and weight,
The easy-going measure to the grave
Spondees some portion os its birthright gave;
But while it gave thern room, would not resign
The second, fourth, or sixth place in the line.
In Accius· famous trimeters you find
Exti-emely few examplae of this kind ;

And as sor Ennius. his verses crawl

Across the stage with such a tedious drawi,
They tell of haste and want of care, or, worse,
A blamesul ignorance of the laws os verse.
