»oux 1.] Satire V. 1 35

Whilst 1 have reason, shall 1 e’er

With a true-hoened friend compare!
The hostel, which adjaeent lies

To tbe Campanian bridge,* supplies

The quarters sor our evening halt,

And the parochiatus wood and salt,

For legates the accustomed boon.

Next day at Capua† by noon

Our mules are all unpacked. Away

Maecenas hies at bau to play;

To sleep myself and Virgil go!

For tennis practice is, we know,

Injurious, beyond all quesdon,

Both to weak eyes and weak digestion.
N ext day Cocceius’ country seat,

Above the Caudian 1nns,1 replete

With all good things receives us. Now,

Ο Muse, relate, and briefly, how

The battle raged that asternoon

Betwixt Sarmentus the buffoon

And Messius Cicirrhus‚——and

Their pedigree, these warriors grand.

Messius is of tbe famous race

Of Oscus, while, oh woful case!

Sarmentus’ mistress still exists.

So ancestored into the lists

They came. Sarmentus first made play;

“ You're like a wild horse, you, 1 say !'’
