368 Epz'stle II [Boox 11.

Jewels, plate, pictures‚ silks, and rich array,
Statues of marble, ivory, Tuscan clay,
There are who have not ; one I can recall,
Who nothing cares to have such things at all.
Why loves one brother “ toys and lust and wine '²
More than the rich palm-groves of Palestine‚
The while another, rich but not content,
With axe and flame from dawn to dark is bent
On clearing serub and timber from his land,
A mystery is, which only may be sch‘nned
By the boon Genius, guardian of our birth,
The god that watches o'er each son of earth,
Haunts all our steps in ever-changing guise,
In gloorn or gladness lives with us and dies*

For me, Ι mean to use, and, as I want,
Draw freely from my heap, though it be scant,
Nor dread the angry cavil of my heir,
To find so little left for him to share.
Yet shall my lise the difference show between
Riot and mirth, the frugal and the mean.
To fool your wealth away is want of'sense ;
'Tis wisdom not to grudge a chance expense,

⁴* See note on the First Epistle of this Book, p. 351, ante. The Rev.
J. E. Yonge, in his valuable edition of Horaoe. cites in iuustmtion of
this passage the following linoe from Spenser's ¹ Fairy Queen ' (Book 11.
Canto xii. St. 47). where¹ having mentioned a Genius, the poet says it
was not-

¹⁸ That celestiall powre to whom the mre ,
Of life, and generation os all
Thm lives, perteines in charge particulare.
Who wondrous things concerning our welsare.
And strange phantomes doth lett us oste fonsae,
And oste of secret ills bids us beware:
That is ourselse‚ whom though we do not see.
Yet meh doth in himselfe it well peroeive to bee.
Therefore a god him sage Antiquity
Did wisely make, and good Agdistes eall.''
