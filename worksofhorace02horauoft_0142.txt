128 Satira IV. '[uoox 1.

Comes it from any man with whom I've lived as friend with
friend ?

He who an absent friend assails, nor him does not defend,

When others blame ; who strives to catch men's idiot merri·

By repartees and reckless jokes ; who can as fact present

What never was, or secrets blab intrusted to his care;

That man is black of heart3 of him, O son of Rome, beware!

On couches three at supper oft twelve people you may see,

Of whom one splashes all the rest with coarse scurrility,

Except the host; and even he must brook the ribald's vein,

Soon as outspoken Liber gives the beart unbounded rein.

To you, who hold us satirists in such disgust and dread,

This man seems spirited and frank, jocose and not iu-bred‚

Whilst I, if 1 but dare to'smile‚ because—myself to quote—

Rufillus smells all pouncet-box‚ Gargonius stinks all ἕως*

Am deemed by you malignant and black-hearted, Now
suppose,

That in your presence somebody should chance to talk of
those

Huge larcenies of Petillius Capitolinus, you

Would thus speak out in his defence‚ as you are wont to doz

“ Capitolinus from a boy I've known as chum and friend;

Prompt was he ever at my call a helping hand to lend,

And glad am I to see him walk the town at large; yet how

He 'scaped conviction is to tne a mystery, 1 vow.”†

† The render of the ‘Anti-jacobin' will be reminded here of Can-
ning's description os the “ Candid Friend ε ¹¹—-

‘¹ Candour. which spares its soes, nor e’er descends
With bigot zeal to combat sor its friends:
Candour‚ which loves in seesaw strain to tell
Of acting foolishly‚ but meaning well:

Too nice to praise by wholesale‚ or to blame,
Convinced that all men’s motives are the same:
