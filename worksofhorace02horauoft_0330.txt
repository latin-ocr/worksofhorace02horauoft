316 To Quintius. [1³00ss 1.

More cool, more clear, not Thracian Hebrus flows,*
Balm for head-pains, and ‚sor the stomach’s woes.
This dear, yea truly exquisite, retreat
Keeps me in health through even September's heat-

Now for yourself. Your lise no follies mar,
If you be truly what men say you are.
WVe Romans all declare, indeed we do,
If there’s a happy man alive, 'tis you.
Yet here I dread lest you should be more prone
To trust another's judgment than your own,
And lest you may not, as you ought, conclude,
That none are happy but the wise and good.
So might a man, if people told him he
Was sound and healthy as a man could be,
When dinner-time arrives, although he feel
Feverish and out of sorts, the fact conceal,
And eat till the cold shiver makes him stop,
And from his greasy hands the viands drop.
'Tis a false shame, and marks a sool, 1 swear,
To hide a sore that needs the doctor's care.

Say, some one soothed your ears, with accents bland
Extolling thus your fights by sea and land :
'¹ May Jove, Rome's great protector and your own,
So order things that it may ne'er be known,
Which sor the other’s weal most deeply cares,
Her citizens for yours, or you sor theirs !’
Such eulogy as this you would admit
As for no other than Augustus fit;
But when you let folks call you wise and good
Without demur, are you quite sure you should?
“ 'Why not? Such praise is pleasant,” you reply
‘¹ You like it well yourself, then why not 1 ?”
