SATIRE IV.

HORACE.
WI-IENCE and whither, Catius?

cxrms.
Nay,

Indeed, indeed, Ι cannot stay,

For I am trying, might and main,
To print some doctrines on my hrain,
That are quite novel, and surpass
The teachings of Pythagoras,

And his, whom Anytus indicted,*
Yea, even Plato’s the far-sighted.

HORACE.
At such a time to stop you so,
Is very, very wrong, 1 know3
But pray, forgive ς for even should
Some points your memory elude,
Just for the moment, one and all
You’ll very speedily recall.
For be it art or nature, who
Can eope, sor memory, with you?

cxrms.

Nay, 1 just then was full of dread,

1 ne'er should keep them in my head,
⁴* Soet-ata
