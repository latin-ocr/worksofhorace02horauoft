m· ι] To Maecmas. 269

How many. be their hobbies what they may.
But tire of riding them in half a day!
“No bay in all the world so sweeh so sair.
As may with Baiae? Dives eries, ‘⁴ compare !”
And bay and lake anon are made to feel
Their mushroom owner's misdirected zeaL*
A new whim strikoe him—“With your tools‚'' he'll say,
‘⁵ Off to Teanum pack by break οἱ day ἔ ”
The nuptial conch, we see itin his hall—
“A single lise,·· he says, “is best of all.''
'But let him be a bachelor. and then
‘⁸ N one, nonel‘he vows‚ “are bloet but married men !”
Who will provide me with a noose to bind
And hold a. Proteus of this shifty kind?
Are poor men better? No Ξ They’re J‘ust as swist
Their gai-ret, barber, cookshop‚ bath to shift:
They'll hire a boat sor pleasure, and in that
Be quite as sick as Croesus in his yacht.†
If, when we meet. my bairis cut one-half
More short one side than t'other, then you laugh ;
You laugh, if 'neath a tunic fresh you spy
A frayed-out shirt‚ oris my gown’s awry.
How. if my mind to ends confficting runs,
Seeks what it shunned, and what it sought for shuns,
sways to and fro, as is on ocean tossed,
Tin lise's straight course is in mere chaos lost,

ν. ⁴* Compare this with what Horace says in Ode XVIII. Book 11.

, > Teanum, now Teano, was a town in Campania, about thiny miles
„¹ inland from Baiae. Horaoe's millionaire acts like the modern nouveau

ε . rickewho. tiring of a mansion at Brighton before it was finishod, should
, send off the workmen to complete a palatial residence for him at Chisel-

:‚ ἶ lmrst or Sevenoaks. The building of magnificent mansions hemme a

‚f - nge in the days of Augustus.

·Ι· Evexy holiday ax Brighton or Hastings shows that what Horace

π.. ÷ says of the poor excursionists of his timoe is no less true of those of
ς ⁴ our own.
