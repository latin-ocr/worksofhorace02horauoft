Book J. 37

The marhot Professor Sellar on this subject, in his ⁴ Roman Poets
dtheAngmnAge’p. 99, are sure to bevalued byall lovers of
Horace ε ,“ O'f the contemporary poets and critics,” he says, ‘⁸ whose
work: ate extant, Horace is much the most important witness, from
the clearness of his judgmeut, the celmness of his temperameng
and the intimate tcrms of friendship on which he lived with the
older poet. Unlike virgil, who, from reasons of health or natural

inclination, or devotion to his art, had chosen the ‘secretum iter a
sanctatis semita m'tae,’ and cherished few, but close, intimacies,

with whom he uses the language of warm and admiring affection.

These are Maeoenas and Virgil. whatever may have been the date
