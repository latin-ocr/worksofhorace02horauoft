Satire VIII.

As soon as these were cleared away,
A serving-boy, in spruce array,
Wiped with a cloth of purple grain
The table, which was maple plain.

[Boon 11.

The dropt and broken meats, whate’er -

Was useless, or, left lying there,
Might to the diners give offence,
Another pageboy gathered thence.
Like some Athenian virgin grand,
With Ceres’ symbols in her hand,
Comes swart Hydaspes, bearing high
Plain Caecuban, and followed by
Alcon, with Chian, which was dead,
Bouquet as well as body fied.

On this our host, “ Maecenas, sir,

If you, to what they've brought prefer
Falern, or Alban, pray command!
Believe me, we have both at hand.”

HORACE.

Perplexing plenty! But 1 yearn,

My dear Fundanius, to learn,

Who were the other fellows present,
That made the feast so very pleasant?

FUNDAN ms.

I was at top, and, next to me,

Viscus Thurinus3 Varius, he·-

Yes, it was he—came next below ;

T hen with Servilius Balatro
Vibidius—one at either end—

Each came there as M'aecenas’ ffiend:
N ext Nomentanus, who was put

At top, our host, and at the foot ·
