132 Satire V. [soom.

To rob of its expected rations,
And wait‚ with anything but patience,
Whilst my companions, well employed,
Their supper leisurely enjoyed.·³²⁴

Now ’gan the night with gentle hand
To sold in shadows all the land,
And stars along the sky to scatter,
When there arose a hideous clatter,
Slaves slanging bargemen, bargemen slaves;
“ Ho, haul up there! How now, ye knaves,
Inside three hundred people stufl}
Already there are quite enough! ”
Collected were the fares at last,
The mule that drew our barge made fast,
But not till a good hour was gone.
Sleep was not to be thought upon,
The cursed guests were so provokfflg,
The bull-frogs set up such a croaking.
A bargeman too, a drunken lout,
And passenger, sang turn about,
In tones remarkable sor strength,
Their absent sweethearts, till at length
The passenger began to doze,
When up the stalwart bargeman rose
His fastenings from the stone unwound
And left the mule to graze around3

⁴* At Appii Forum the travellers took the boat, which was to carry
them to Terracina by the oenal, which had been constructed between

these places by Augustus, with the view, among others. of draining the ·

Pomptine Marshes. It was nineteen miles long, and travelless, accord-
ing to Strabo, were in the habit of getting over this part oi* their Journey

during the night. Passing as it did through the Pomptine Marwa, the ’

mesquitoes and the frogs, which rdbbed Horace of his sleep, were inevi-
table incidents, the terrors of which travellers in modern Italy mn well
appreciate.
