still, for the men, who rather would be read,
Than sace an audience whose caprice they dread,
Some little favour 1 would dare to crave,
If that high-worthy shrine. which late you gave
Apollot* you would see with volumes filled,
And have at heart to spur the poet-guild
With more assiduous zeal to struggle on
Up the steep slopes of grassy Helicon.

Much mischies often to ourselves we do.
We barda—(here 1 am a delinquent too),—
As when on you some volume we have pressed,
When you were busy, or had need os rest;
When we show temper, is a friend shall dare
To hint one single couplet wants repair;
When, without asking, we recite once more
Passage on passage, which we've read before ;
When we complain, that no one sees how fine
The grace, the finish of ourxevery line;
When we expect, that hearing, as you will,
That we in turning verse have some small skill,
You'll send for us, secure us from the blight
Of pinching want, and order us to write.

Yet ’tis of moment to select with care
The guardians of the Sanctuary, where
The statesman’s, Warrior's, fame shall be en-

No theme sor minstrel of a vulgar kind.
Remember how Great Alexander once
Was fond of Choerilus, that arrant dunce,
Who, for the bungling verses that he made.
In solid golden Philips was repaid.
But as spilt ink leaves blots that will not stir,
So will bad verse the nobleet actions blur.
