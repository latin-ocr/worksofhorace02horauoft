EPODE XIII.
To ms FRlENDS.

ITH storm and wrack the sky is black, and sleet and
dashing rain
With all the gathered streams of heaven are deluging the
plain ; ’
Now roars the sea, the forests roar with the shrill north wind
of Thrace,
Then let us snatch the hour, my friends, the hour that flies
apace,
Whilst yet the bloom is on our cheeks‚ and rightsully we may
With song and jest and jollity keep wrinkled age at bay!
Bring forth a jar of lordly wine, whose years my own can mate,
Its ruby juices stained the vats in Torquatus’ consulate 3
No word os anything that's sad; whate'er may be amiss,
The Gods belike will change to some vicissitude of bliss !
With Achaemenian nard bedew our locks, and troubles dire
Subdue to rest in every breast with the Cyllenian lyre!
So to his peerless pupil once the noble Centaur sang;
“ Invincible‚ yet mortal, who from goddess Thetis sprang,
Thee waits Assaracus’s realm, where arrowy Simois glides,
That realm which chill Scamander’s rill with scanty stream
divides, .
W'hence never more shalt thou return‚—the Parcae so decree,
Nor shall thy blue-eyed mother home again e'er carry thee.
Then chase with wine and song divine each grief and trouble
there,
The sweetest, surest antidotes of beauty-marring care !”
