An very fine, most sage and most revered!

But yet the street-boys twaek you by the bend,

And if you don't disperse them with your stick,

They’ll mob you, hustle you, torment and nick,

O mightioet os kings, the livelong day,

Storm, swear, and bluster howsoeer you may.
And now an end! whilst you your kingship steep

ln fanhing baths, as nasty as they're chag),

And on your myzl-movements not oue ffiend,

Exoep‘t that fool Crispinus,st shall attend,

wunnffieuds 1 love, should 1 theirpatience try,

Regard my sonia with a kindly eye,

Andl totheminspiteoftheixsshaucling,

More happy humble 1 than you the king!
