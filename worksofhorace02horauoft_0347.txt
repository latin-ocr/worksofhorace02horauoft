nrm xm] To Maecmas. 3 3 3

Who trusts himself. and leaves the beaten track,

Will soon have hosts of sollowers at his back.

’Twas in my measures Italy first heard

· The tonet Iambic os the Parian bard.

These and his spirit were my model,—not

The words that drove Lycambes‘all distraught ; ⁴¹·

Yet should you deck me not with scantier bays,

Because my style was modelled on his lays.

With her strong numbers Sappho blends a tone

Caught from Archilochus to swell her own ε

So too Alcaeus, though unlike, we know.

Both in his them& and in his rhythmic flow.

He neither seek a simin-law, on whose

Vexed head to pour the rancours os his muse,

Nor yet in fierce ealumnious distichs chide,

To weave a halter for a faithless bride.

Him, too, till then by Latium’s bards unsung,

1 made familiar on our Roman tongue ; ’1-

And ’tis my pride, that gentle hands and eyes

The strains that else had been unheard of prize.
Ask you, what makes ungracious readers laud

My works at home, and rail at them abroad?

”ris that 1 will not stoop to buy men’s votes

By costly dinners, or by cast-off coats;

’Tis that when men of rank their poems read,

1 keep away, nor will their merits plead ς
