146 Satira VJ. · [mox 1.

I keep my couch till ten, then walk a while,
Or having read or writ what may beguile
A quiet after hour, anoint my limbs
With oil,—not such as filthy Natta skims
From lamps defrauded of their unctuous fare.
And when the sunbeams, grown too hot to-bear‚
VVarn me to quit the field, and hand-bal! play,
The bath takes all my weariness away.
Then having lightly dined, just to appease
The sense of empfiness, I take mine ease,
Enjoying all home's simple luxury.

This is the life of bard unclogged, like-me,
By stern ambition’s miserable weight,
And hence, I own with gratitude, my state
Is sweeter, ay, than though a quaestor's power
From sire and grandsire's sires had been my dower.

Forum during the exoevations conducted within the last few years by
Signor Pietro Rosa, and which now stand in the Forum, is said by the
archaeologists to represent Marsyas. Why they arx-ive at this conclu·
sion, except as arguing, from the spot where these bas-reliess were
found, that they were meant to perpetuate the remembranoe of the old
statue of Marsyas, is certainly not very apparent from anything in the
figure itself.
