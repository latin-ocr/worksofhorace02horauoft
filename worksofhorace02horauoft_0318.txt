EAR Iccius,·¹· if you rightly use
The vast Sicilian revenues,

Which sor Agrippa you collect,
’Twere very madness to expect
That greater plenty e’er should be
By kindly Jove bestowed on thee.
No more complaining, friend Ξ sor poor
'rhat man is not who can insure
Whate’er sor life is needsul found.
Let your digestion be but sound,
Your side unwrung by spasm or stitch,
Your foot unconscious of a twitch,
And could you be more truly blest‚
Though of the wealth of kings possessed?

If 'midst such choiee of dainties rare.
You live on herbs and hermit’s fare.
You would live on so, young or old,
Though fortune flooded you with gold;
Because 'tis not in power of pelf
To make you other than yourself,

ὓ It was to this Iccius that Horace addoessed the Twenty-ninth ode ¹
of the First Book ; see note on this Ode, ante, p. 50. Horace tells him ὲ
he ought to be thankful sor having so good a post as he obviously had ᾗ,
under Agrippa, where he probably received a peroenuge οιι all the
revenue collected. The old hankering after wealth, although be was a ξ’
man of frugal tastoe. must have cropped out in some letter to which ,„

this is an answer.
