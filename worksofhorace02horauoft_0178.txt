Were no less mad an act, than his, who should

Into a forest carry logs of wood.'’

So whilst bombastic Furius will slay

His Memnon, and give Rhine a head of clay,·¹·

1 toy with trifles, never meant to gain

Poetic honours in Apollo's fane,

On Tarpa’s verdict ; † nor become the rage

Of thronging audiences upon the stage.
Fundanius, you alone of living men

Speak with the old dramatic vigunt, when

You show us Chremes tricked‚ old wretched man,

By Davus, and a specious courtesan.

In grave iambic measure Pollio sings

For our delight the deeds of mighty kings.

The stately epic Varius leads along,

And where is voice so resonant, so strong?

The muses of the woods and plains have shed

There every grace and charm on Virgil's head.

Satire, where Varro failed, and other men,

I find is best adapted to my pen;

An humble follower of him, who first

Revealed its powers, 1 own myself, nor durst

From his broad forehead snatch the wreath, which fame

Has planted there, ’midst general acclaim.

³* Horace seems to refer here to one Furius Bibaculus, and some work
of his. in one os which Memnon, his hero, had been done to death
by him in turgid verse. and in another the Rhine had been stripped
by his treatment of the bffluty and grandem· associated with that
noble river. He refers to him again in the First Epistle of the Second ⁷
Book.

† Maecius Tarpa held the office of licenser of plays, an office to which.
as we leam from Cicero, he was appointed by Pompey on the opening
of his theme A.U.c. 699. He was obviously a man of fine critical

judgment, and Horace in the ‘Ars Poetica' recommends the younger s³
Piso to give nothing to the world till it has received the sanction os ’

his approval.
