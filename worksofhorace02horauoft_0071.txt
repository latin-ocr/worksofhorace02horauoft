Book I. 5 7

Among the birds, with his remorselecs brand

Flaming destrudion from his dexter hand!

You, too,5eLam,whodidgmxdmygrounds‚

onoespadous, nowshmnkto thesesennty homnis,

Reoeive your tribute t-in those wenlthier years

A oelr mede sacrifice sor connum steers 3

But for my tiny farm a lamb is now

Tne mighty all 1 can afford to νον :—

To you a lamb shall sall, round which a ring

of rustic lads and lasses blithe shall sing,

‘Iol Io! good winae and plenteous harvest bring 2’
Now with the little that 1 have content,

My steps are ne’er on toilsome journeys bent;

1 shun the dog-star’s beat in leasy shade,

where some clear runnel triekles through the glade 3

Nor do 1 blush at times the plough to guida

Or with the good the tardy steers to chide,

Or in my bosom bear a lambkin home,

'Or kid, its heedleoe dam has lest to roam.

Spare my small flock, ye thievoe and wolves3 from some
Huge hend of countloes beevae your prey should come ;
For never do 1 fail each year, with due
Lustmtion, to assoil my shepherd too,

And 0’er the gentle Pales sprinkle free

Milk in libations for my kine and me.

Ye gods, draw near, nor spurn, though served on clay,
Suehgiftsashomesopoorasmineoenpay!

Of plastic clay the husbandman of yore

The mli-st vessels made, that held his stote.

Not sor ancestral lands nor gold thirst Ι,
Νοι· harvests gamer-ed in years long gone by ;
Enongh sor me a little crop to reap,

Upon a little bed to sink to sleep,

And on the mat sor many a day I've pressed
To stretch my limbs eontentedly to rest.
What joy within my mistress' arms-to lie,
And har the cruel vinds go howling by;
Or, when chin Auster drenches all the plain,
