DAVUS.
With certain men vice is ‚their food,
A passion steadily pursued,
Others are never wicked long,
But oscillate 'twixt right and wrong. ι
Three rings to-day would Priscus wear,
Te-morrow his left hand goes bare,
N ever two hours the same ; one night
A fop, the next his rags a sight.
Then, taken with a sudden fit,
His princely mansion he would quit
For some low den, no slave would choose
That had a character to lose3
Now bent at Rome on drabs and drinking,
Now all for Athens and hard thinking;
The gods, that rule all kinds of weather,
When he was born had clashed together*
Then that distinguished diner out,
Old Volanerius, when the gout—
It served him right—had knotted so
His finger—joints‚ he could not throw
The dice himself, a man engages
To throw for him on daily wages.†

⁴* Priscus seems to have been much the same kind of person as the ’

Tigellius of Satire 1. 3, there described as made up of inconsistencioe—
⁸ ¹ Nil fuit unquam sic imparsibi.'' Dryden improved upon Horace in his

fine sketch in the ‘Absalom and Aehitophel,' concluding with the linos :— Ἴ t

“ Was everything by stans, and nothing long,
But in the course of one revolving moon
Was chymist, fiddler. statoeman, and buffoon.''

† Cowper's lines in “The 'rask'' (ὂψ) present uswith a kindred ι ³

icture :-
p ⁴¹ The paralyfic, who ean hold her oerds.
But <annot play them. borrows a friend's hand
To deal and shuffle. to divide and sort
Her mingled suits and sequenm: and sits.
Spectatress both and spectacle. a sad
And silent cipher. while her proxy plays.” -
