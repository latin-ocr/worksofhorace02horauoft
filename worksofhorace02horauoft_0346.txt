3 32 To Moecenas. [noox x.

‘¹ Ye that drink not, to court or change repair,

But from sweet song I charge you to sorbeat ! '’

1 spoke; and bards have ever since, men say,

Toped wine all night, and reeked of it all day.*
What Ξ is a man shall mimic Cato’s air,

By naked feet, grim looks, and cloak threadbare,

Does he by this embody to our view

Cato's great character and virtues too?

Poor Cordus, bent on passing for a wit,

To give Timagenes back hit for hit,

With so much energy and passion spoke,

That in the effort a blood-vessel broke.†

x-Vhat mere delusion is it which reflects

A man of note by copying his desects?

Yet some would, if perchance my colour fail,

Drink cumin—wine to make themselves look pale.:t

O servile crew! How oft your antics mean

Have moved my laughter, oh, how ost my spleen!
I was the first new regions to explore,

And boldly tread where none had trod before.

evidence that he thought of it otherwise than as Iago speaks of it, “a
good familiar creature, if it be well used. '’ Ennius says of himself,
that he never wrote poetry but when he had the gnua—“Nunquam
poftor nisi podager’'-that is. when he was suffering from, not when he
was inspired by, wine.

ὕ There is no such dictum in the extant poems ot* Horace as that to
which he here refers.

† This must refer to some story well known in Rome at the time,
Cordus was a Mauritanian by birth 3 Timagenes, a native of Alexandria,
had been brought as a slave to Rome, where he was bought by Faustus,
the son of Sulla, who gave him his freedom. He was a iamed rheto-
rician, patronised by Augustus, but lost his favour by too free speaking,
and was forbidden his house. Asinius Pollio subsequently took him up,
made much of him, and gave him a house at Tusculum, where he died.

ss Pliny (XX. 15) describes this plant as giving a palliet hue to the oom-
plexion. So in ‘'the days when George the Third was king.’¹ verse-
mongers turned down their shirt-collars‚ and adopted the aits of a languid
debauchee, after the manner of Lord Byron.
