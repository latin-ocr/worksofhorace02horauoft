mnam-ss bonos, by beidam riteh
Smoebed from the jaws of famisbed bitch.
And Sagana, the while, with govm
Tueked to the kneoe» stalks up and down,
Sprinkling in room and hau and stair
‘ua magio hell-dmps, with her hair
Bristling on end, like furious bear,

Or some sea-archita vashed on shore ;
whilst Veia, by runorse unstayed,
Gru-'ns at her tofi, as she with spade
‘nnat ssags not digs a pit, when-ein

The buy embedded to the chin, .

with nothing sem save head and thr-eat,
Like those who in the water float,

suan daintioe see before him set,

A maddening appetite to ubet,

‘rhen snatched‘ away before his eyes,
Tin, samished, in despair he diem

Have closed on the nutasted sood,

His ‚sapless marrow and dry spleen

May dmg a philtre-dranght obscene.
Nor vere these all the hideous σειν,

But Anminian Folia, too,

Who with insatiate lewdnoes swells,

And drags,'by hest massaliam spells,

The moon and stars down from the sky?
Ease-loving Naploe νοτυς, vas by ;

And every hamlet round about

Declarae she m, beyond a doubt.

Now forth {he fietce Canidia {praua
And stin she gnawed with rouen fang
