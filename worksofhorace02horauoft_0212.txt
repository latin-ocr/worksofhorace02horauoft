Satire III. [mox 11.

To Ajax‚ O Atrides, why
Do you the burial·rite deny?
“ I’rn king.'’ (Oh, that, of course, should be
Answer enough for churls like me Ξ)
“And order what is right, I trust.
Thinks any man, Ι am unjust‚
Why, then, let him speak out his thought!
He has my pardon, ere 'tis soughtss'
Mightiest of kings, when Troy is ta’en,
May the gods grant you power, again
The fleet in safety back to lead!
May 1, then, question you indeed,
And talk this matter out? “Proceed !’'
T hen, why rots Ajax on the ground,
He, next Achilles self renowned,
Who ofttimes, foremost of the brave,
The Greeks did from destruction save?
That Priam’s people, Primn, too,
May joy, unsepultured to view
The man, who did their youth's hest bloom
Deprive of an ancestral tomb?
“ Stark mad, he slew a thousand sheep,
And, as they fell, with curses deep
Kept shoufing, he was bent to slay us,
Myself, Ulysses‚ Menelaus!”
And to the altar when you led
Your child at Aulis, on her head
Sprinkling the sacred salt and bran,
What then were you, O impious man ?-
Were you in your right senses? “ How! ’³
Where was the mighty mischief, now,
If Ajax in his fury wild
Did slay these sheep? Nor wife nor child
Harmed he one jot ;—he merely cursed
The Atridae, take it at the worst.
