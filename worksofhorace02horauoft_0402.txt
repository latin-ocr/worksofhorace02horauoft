Could audiences be kept, who were, no doubt,

By the religious service half tired—out,

And, being flushed with wine, could scarce restrain

The lawless humours of their madcap veinst*

But look you bring them in in such a way,—
xThese saucy satyrs‚—so blend gravewith gay,

That neither god nor hero, seen but late

In gold and purple clad, and royal state,

Shall to poor low-roofed cottages come down,

Talking the thoughts and language of a down:

Nor, anxious not to creep too near the ground,

Catch at the clouds, and rave in empty sound.

The tragic Muse, whose lips it were profane

With flippant phrases or light jests to stain,

If by the story called upon to mix

With roguish satyrs and their sportive tricks,

Should move with all the chaste reserve and state

Os a grave matron dancing at a sete.

Were Ι, my friends, to write this kind os play,

Not to the homely phrase of every day

would I restrict mysels, in foolish sear

Of coming to the tragic tone too near,

As though no clear distinction should be made,

When Davus speaks, or an unblushing jade

Like Pythias, when she of a talent gulls .

Old liquorish Simo, most sublime of culls;†

Or when Silenus, by the god revered

VVhom from his insaney he watched and reared.‡

* Spectator functusque sacris et potus et exlex. As these plays were
performed aster a Dionysiae festival, the spectators were not likely to be
in a mood for any serious performanee.

† According to Cmquius, Pythias was the name of a slave girl in
one of the lost plays of Lucilius (Orelli thinks of Caecilius), who wheedled
money out of her master Simo as a portion for his daughter.

ζ Silenus is said to have educated Bacchus. strange that in all the
ancient representations of this Mentor οἰ a divine Telemachus, he should

be represented in the guise of a sensual drunkard.
