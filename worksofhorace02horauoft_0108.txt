94 Notes to tlte Epodes.

ὡς τοῦτον τὸν χηρδν ἐγὼ σὺν δαίμονι τέκε,
ὥς τάκοιθ ὑπ’ ἔρωτος ὁ Μύνδιος αὐτίκα Δέλφις.

“ As this image os wax 1 melt here by aidance demonic,
Myndian Delphis shall soqmelt with love’s passion anon?

Virgil uses the same image in the Eighth Eclogue (l. 80) 2-—

Limus ut hic durescit, ά haec ut cera liquarit,
Uno eodemque igni, sic nostro Daphnis amore.

‘¹ As hardens with the sels-same fire this clay,
That melts the while this mould of wax away,
So, so may Daphnis melt with love sor me,
So with hard beart all other wooers see1”

And Hypsipyle says of Medea (Ovid, Heroid. vi. 91) :—

Devovet absentes simulacraque cerea figit,
Et miserum tenues in jecur urget acus.

‘¹ The absent she'binds with her spells, and figures os wax she devsses,
And in their agonised spleen fine-pointed needlee she thmsts.”

Iu these passages we are again reminded of the practices of modern
sorcery. The familiar instance of Eloenor, Duchaes os Glo’ster,
who was accused along with Hume, Margery Jourdain, and others,
of attempting by means os an image of this kind to eompass the
death of Henry VI., will occur to every ond. The older dramatists
are full of allusions to the practice.
