Satire IX. [mox 1.

“ Upon my lise, indeed, Ι can’t3

Of law I’m wholly ignorant;

And you know where I'm hurrying to.”

“ I’rn fairly puzzled what to do.

Give you up, or my cause?’¹ “ Oh, me,

Me, by all means !'' “1 won't,” quoth he;

And stalks on, holding by me tight.

As with your conqueror to fight

Is hard, 1 follow. “ How‚” anon

He rambles off—“ how get you on,

You and Maecenas? To so few

He keeps himself. So elever, too!

No man more dexterous to seiae

And use his opportunities.

Just introduce me, and you'll see, .

We'll pull together famously3

And hang me, then, if with xny backing‚

You don’t send all your rivals packing ἔ ”
“ Things in that quarter, sir, proceed

In very different style indeed.

No house more free from an that’s base,

ln none cabals more out of place.

It hurts me not, is there 1 see

Men richer, better read than me.

Each has his place! ’² “ Amazing tact!

Scarce credible ! '’ “ But ’tis the facff

’ “ Υοιι quicken rny desire to get

An introduction to his set.'’

“ With merit such as yourS, you need
But wish it, and you must succeed.
He's to be won, and that is why
Of strangers he's so very shy.”

“ I'll spate no pains, no arts, no shists!
His servants I'll corrupt with gifts.
