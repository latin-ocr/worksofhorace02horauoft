290 To. Maecenas. [noox ι.

The woes blabbed o'er our wine, when Cinara chose ¹¹*
To tease me, cruel flirt—ah, happy woes!

Through a small hole a field-mouse, lank and thin.
Had squeezed his way into a barley bin,
And, having sed to satness on the grain,
Tried to get out, but tried and squeezed in vain.
“ F riend,” cried a weasel, loiterin'g thereabout,

“Lean you went in, and lean you must get out.”
Now, at my head if solks this story throw,
Whate‘er 1 have I’m ready to sorego;

1 am not one, with sorced meats in my throat,
Fine saws on poor men’s dreamless sleep to quote.
Unless in soul as very air I'm free,

Not all the wealth os Araby sor me.

You've ofttimes praised the reverent, yet true
Devotion, which my heart has shown sor you.
King, father, 1 have called you, nor been slack
In words of gratitude behind your back;

But even your bounties, if you care to try,
You’ll find I can renounce without a sigh.
Not badly young Telemachus replied,
Ulysses’ son, that man so sorely tried: .
“No mettled steeds in Ithaca we want;

The ground is broken there, the herbage scant.
Let me, Atrides, then, thy gifts declin‘e,

In thy hands they are better sar than mine 1²²
Yes, little things fit little folks. In Rome
The Great 1 never feel myself at home.

Let me have Tibur, and its dreamful ease,
Or sost Tarentum's nerve-relaxing breeze.
