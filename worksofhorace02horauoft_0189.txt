Our adversaries. By this mle„

The wolf attacks with tecua, the buu
With horus. And why, but sor the fact,
’nnat instinct prompte them so to act?
You’d lave his long-lived mother’s fate
'ro scaeva, that mere profligate?

¹ munus.
Why not? His hand he’ll ne'er imbrue
1 n crime.

HORACE.
ι 01³, it were strange, did you

See wolves‘employ their heels in fighting,
Or steens attack their soes by biting!
But hemlock in her honey may
Take’ the old lindy from his way.

In brief, is 1 shall draw my brath
Into a oelm old age, or death
Hangs o'er me with his eben wing,
Rich, poor, at Rome, or wandering
In lonely exile, whether bright
Or dark my life, 1 still shall write.

TREBATIUS.
My son, my son, ΔΙ greatly ἴω,
'rhatyom-swillbeabriefcareer,
And some of those great solks you took
For friends will freae you with a look.

And did so with impunity,

Taring· away the gustering skin,
'rhat masked the rottenness within? ’
