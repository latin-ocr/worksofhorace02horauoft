SATIRE VII.

HERE’S not an idler, 1 suppose,
Or shasper about town¹ but knows,
How mongrel Persius, t’other day,
Took vengeance in a wondrous way
Upon proscribed Rupilius, hight
The King, for his *envenomed spite.
Persius was rich, his fortune made
At Clazomene in thriving trade,
And was besides-no pleasant thing—
lnvolved in lawsuits with the King.
A hard man he, a thorough hater‚
The King was good, but he was greater,
Vain, headstrong, and for any brawl
Armed with a tongue so steeped in gall,
No Barrus or Sisenna known
’Gainst him could ever hold his own.
But for Τὴε Kings—Au had in vain

Been tried to reconcile these twain;
But as a law, when men fan out,
Just in proportion as they're stout
In heart or sinews, neither will'
Give in, till one be killed or kin.
The strife 'twixt Hector, Priam's son,
And fierce Achilles thus was one,
which death alone could bring to pause ς
And plainly for this simple cause,
