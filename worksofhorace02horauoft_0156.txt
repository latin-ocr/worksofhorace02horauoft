For what my father was he is.'' Oh rare!

And therefore you with Paulus may compare,

Or great Messala! Novius, too, you see,

Though tenscore hulking wains, and funerals three,

Stun all the forum with their mingling roar,

Can roll his thunder-tones triumphant o’er

Trumpet and horn, and bray of man and beast‚

And there’s some merit in that seat at least.

Grudge me the tribune’s honours, why should he

Be jealous of the favour shown by thee,—

To choose thy friends for honest worth alone?

Dropping some few brief words (sor bashfiilness

Robbed me of utterance)‚ I did not profess,

That I was sprung of lineage old and great,

Or used to canter round my own estate,

On Satureian barbs'f· but what and who

I was as plainly told. As usual, you

obviously a breed in great request‚ and only to be bought by the rich.
