Τ he Art ff Poetry. 397

orpheus. interpreter os heaven to man,
The savage weaned that in the wild woods ran
From brutish‚ bloody ways: and hence the same,
That he could pards and ravening lions tame.
Amphion, too, when Thebes' great wall arose,*
Moved mighty' rocks, and placed them where he

chose:

And all by the persuasive tones that sell—
So runs the legend—from his voice and shell.
'Twas wisdom’s office then to mark the line
Betwixt what is profane and what divine ;
The rights of state and subject to adjust;
Put down concubinage and roving lust;
Define what man and wife might do and should:
Build cities up. and grave their laws on wood.
Thus came high honour and abounding praise
To heaven-commissioned poets and their lays.
Then peerless Homer and Tyrtaeus' song
Made manly hearts for martial conflicts strong.
In rhythmic strains men learned the will of sate,
Verse taught the duties of our mortal state;
Sweet poets sang. and, sostened by their art,
Kings dropped their state, and felt they had a heart.

 

Plays were invented, and brought mirth and cheer
To close the long hard labours of the year.†
No need to blush, then, sor the god that sings
Responsive to the Muse's sounding strings !

The charms of verse—the question is not new—
Are they to art or inborn genius due?

ὓ Horace (Odes, 111. xi. 2) says of Amphion. blavit Amphion lapides
canenda. The allusion in the text is to the tradition mentioned by Pau-
sanias, that Amphion, having received from Mercury a golden lyre and
the art to use it. moved by his melody the stenes to take their places in
the walls of Thebes.

ludi.
