Give you the >hope that nobody will know,
And there's no length to which you would not go.
Of myriad sacks of beans steal one, the shame
And sin, if not the loss, are just the same
As though all went. The good mans* viewed with awe
By every judgment-hall and court of law,
XVhen he propitiates the gods by steer
Or pig, first eries aloud for all to hear :
“ O father Janus ! † O Apollo l '² Then
Into a whisper drops his voice again,
And mutters, “ O Laverna, sair and bright‚‡
Grant no suspicion e'er on me may light;
Make me to seem devout and just, and shroud
My srauds and sollies in a friendly cloud !”
The avaricious wretch who stoops and picks
A sarthing up that in the gutter sticks,
How he is either better or more sree
Than any purchased slave, 1 cannot see.
Who covets, dreads; and he who lives in sear
A free man in my eyes will ne'er appear.
A coward runaway from virtue's post
Is he, whose soul is all by gain engrossed.
Kill not your captive3 he will sell. Nay, you
Have twenty uses you may put him to.

“ See how yond justice rails upon yond simple thies. Hark in thine ear:
change places, and bandy-duay, which is the justice, which is the thies? ''—
King Lear, Act iv. sc. 6.

† Janus. commonly called '‘father Janus'' (Janus pater). was wor-
shipped before the other gods. bemuse. according to Ovid (Fasti, 1. 171),
he got a hearing for his worshippers from them.

ἶ Laverna was associated with Mereury as a divinity who, like him,
had the whole tribe of robbers and thieves under her pmteetion,—a sort
of patron saint of larceny and cheating.
