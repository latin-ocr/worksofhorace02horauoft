Your passion then with rein and bit subdue:
1s you don’t master it. ’twill master you.
’Tis while its mouth is sort, the trainer’s skill
Maka the colt pliant to the rider's will ;
The whelp that bayed the stufl'ed skin in the hall*
will hunt the woods, true to his master's call.
'rhen to your yet pure hart thoee maxims lay,
And keep, young friend, all but the good at bay-
After long yoers the scent will still imbue
The jar of that which seasoned it when new-
Such are the ruloe by which my course 1 guide.
And meleome those who'll travel by my side;
But lag who will. οι· push ahad who may.
with even πρὸς pace 1 man to bold my way.
