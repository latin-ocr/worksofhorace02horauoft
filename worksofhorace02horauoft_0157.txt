noox ι] Satin VI. 143

Briefanswumakeme. 1 retia-,anathem
Some nine months aster, summoning me again,
Yon bid me ’mongst your ffiends assume a place:
Andproudlseehthatthus 1 wonthygrace,
Not by an ancestry long known to fame,
But by my life, and beart devoid of blame.
Yet if some trivial saults, and these but few,
My nature, else not much amiss, imbue,
Just as you wish away, yet scarcely blame,
· A mole or two upon a comely frame5

If no man may arraign me of the vice
Os lewdnees, meannaes, nor of avariam
1f pure and innocent I live, and dent
To those 1 love (sels-praise is venial here),
All this 1 owe my father, who, though poor,
Luni ofsome few lean acres, and no more,
Was laath to send me to the village school,
Whereto the sons of men of mark and mle,—
Centurions, and the like—were wont to swarm,
With slate and satchel on sinister arm,
And the poor dole of scanty pence to pay
The starveling teachet on the quarter day;
But boldly took me when a boy to Rome,
There to be taught all arts, that grace the home
Of knight and senator. To see my dress,
And slaves attending, you'd have thoughgmo less
'rhan patrimonial fortunes old and great
Had surnished forth the charges os my state.
When with my tutors, he would still be by,
Nor ever let me wander from his eye;
And in a word he kept me chaste (and this
Is virtue's crown) from all that was amiss,
Nor such in act alone, but in repnte,

« Till even scandal's tattling voice was mute.
