Tben down upon his back he lay,
And snored in a terrific way.

And now day broke, but still we note
No signs of motion in the boat,
T in out a hair-brained seuow sprang
And with a willow cudgel tang
A rouser round the ribs and head
Of mule and bargeman. Then we sped,
But it was ten o'clock and more
Before our party got on shore.

F irst we our hands and faces, wash‚
Feronia‚* where thy waters plash;
Then aster luncheon on we creep
Three miles, whichbring us to the steep
Where Anxur † from its rocks of white
Gleams many armile upon the sight.
''I'was fixed that we should meet with dear
Maecenas and Cocceius here,
Who were upon a mission bound
Of consequence the most profound,
For who so skilled the sends to close
Of those, once friends, who now were soes?
Here my eyes teased me, so that Ι
Black wash was driven to apply.
Meanwhile beloved Maecenas came,
Cocceius too, and brought with them
Fonteius Capito, a man
Endowed with every grace that can
A perfect gentleman commend, ’
And Anthony's especial friend.
