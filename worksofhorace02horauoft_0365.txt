'Twas out of this the chartered sreedom grew,

Which flout on flout in verse Fescennian threw;

And. as each year came round, the verbal dirt

Flew thick and fast. still nobody was hurt.

‘riu the rough jests grew virulent. and made

On honest homes and hearths a shamelese raid.

These who were stung cried out ; those who were not

Felt some concern about the common lot:

So laws were passed, with penalties and fines

To check the scandal of these scurrile lines:

This. and a wholesome terror sor their bones.

Made men find civil tongues and sweeter tonet*

And clownish Latium with her arts imbued;
