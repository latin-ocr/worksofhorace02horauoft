366 Epistle II. [noox 11.

'Twere well, in sooth, I should have done with toys‚
And give up pastimes that are meet for boys,
Not words to match the Latian lyre pursue,
But leam the tones make life serene and true.
So with myself I talk, and this the kind
And train of thought that passes through my mind.
If draught on draught your thirst could not abate,
Full soon you’d tell the doctor of your state.
The more you get, the more you crave ; then how
Dare you to none that damning fact avow?
Some root or simple you are told to use
As panacea for a wound or bruise.
You try them, and they fail you 3 surely, then,
You’d never have recourse to them again?
Men that grow rich, though they were fools before,
Y ou've heard folks say, will now be fools no more.
Well ! Though you’re wealthier, are you wiser? No!
And will you yet to the same Mentors go?
But were it true, that wealth could sense inspire,
could quell fond fears and covetous desire,
You well might blush, if, search the world wound,
A soul more greedy than your own were found.
If that for which you pay your money down
Its owner changes, and becomes your own 3
If simple use to property convert
Even things not bought, as legal men asson,
Yours is the pasture that your dinner yields,
And Orbius' bailiff, when he tills the fields
Which grow the grain that’s eaten at your board,
Feels that ’tis you, not Orbius, are his lord.
You give your cash, and get for it, in fine,
Grapes, poultry‚ eggs, a cask of heady wine 3
stane& of delusion, and heard him eall upon Mt. Garri& to exet him- “
