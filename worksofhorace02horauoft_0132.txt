Satire III. [Boon 1.

Or if he be as stunted, short, and thick
As Sisyphus the dwarf, will call him “ chick !”
If crook'd all ways, in back, in legs, and thighs,
With sostening phrases will the flaw disguise.
So, if our friend too close a fist betrays,
Let us ascribe it to his frugal ways;
Or is another-such we often find-
To flippant jest and braggart talk inclined,
'Tis only from a friendly wish to try
To make the time ’mongst friends go lightly by.
Another’s tongue is rough and over-free,
Let's call it bluntness and sincerity3
A fourth is choleric; him we must screen,
As cursed with feelings for his peace too keen.
This is the course, meffiinks, that makes a friend
And, having made, secures him to the end.

But we. all simple worth inclined to doubt,
Turn virtue's self the seamy side without,
And strIve with damning varnish to incrust
Even those, whose characters are pure and just.
A man shall live a life devoid of blame:
“ A poor weak creature, pitifully tame 1 ’'
Another, slow in thought, and slow in act,
We brand as ‘⁴ dull, a dunderhead in fact l ’²
Here shall be one, around whose way of life
The plots of malice and revenge are rife :
Through these he steers secure, nor lets his foe
One point unguarded find, to plant a blow;
Yet him, that is so wary and discreet,
&Vc charge with tortuous cunning and deceit.
Is one too little circumspect, and apt
To break upon your privacy, when wrapt
Ι n reading or in thought (as ost I should
On thee, Maecenas, if 1 might, intrude),
