uoox 1.] Satire III. 1 17

To your own faults when thus you seal your eye3‚

Why bring a glance your friend to scrutinize

Keen as the eagle’s or the sacred snake’s

Os Epidaurus?* Thinlg, too, this but wakes

As close a scrutiny into your own.

Here is a man, to anger somewhat prone,

And little apt to understand a joke5

His heard of clownish cut might well provoke

A smile, as might his gown hung all askew,

And shoes a world too wide. Weu! Grant this true.

But he is good, no better anywhere,

Your friend withal ; and there is genius there,

Great genius, 'neath a rugged husk. So, then,

On all sides view them, when you judge of men,

But probe yourself especially, to spy

If faults have haply been engenderedtby

Nature or evil ways 3 for fields unsown,

Untilled, are soon by worthless serns o’ergrown.†
Here were it well for us to bear in mind

That lovers to their ladies' saults are blind,

Or think them beauties; as Balbinus shows

A passion sor the wen on Hagna’s nose-

Oh that we blundered in our friendships thus,

And deemed such blundering no shame in us 2

For we are bound to treat a fn‘end’s derect

With touch most tendet, and a fond respect ;

As with his child a father deals‚ who hints

The urchin's eyes are roguish, is he squints;

⁴* The serpents of Epidaurus were celebrated. that being one of the
chief sats of the worship of AEseulapius, with whose worship the
serpent was connected.

’θ’ Why seins? For thirty miles round Rome, probably farther, ferns
may be seen forcing their way up on any patch of land which has gone
out of tillage for a yoer or two. Tine same thing may be seen in
Homoe's Sabine vauey.
