1 84 Satire II. [8003 11.

In what, lads, have Ι or have you had worse eheer,

Since the new man, that now holds our acres», came here?
For Nature has given, nor to him, nor to me,

Nor to any one else, of these acres the see.

He has driven us out. Wen ! Unscrupulous crime,

Or some quirk of the law, will drive him out in time ;

Or, if not, be his hold of them ever so ἕλες

His heir will most certainly oust him at last.

The farm that now goes by Umbrenus’s name,

And by mine went till recently, no one may claim

As exclusively his. 'Tis mine now,—anon

To another the land with its fruits will pass on.
Wherefore keep a stout beart, while you live, boys, and meet
Mischance, if it come, with a courage discreet.”
