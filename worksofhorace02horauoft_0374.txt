360 Epistle II. [noox 11.

Renown and honours followed, and, to boot,
A good round tale of pieces from the loot.
It chanced about this time his chief, being stirred
To take some fortress‚—-where 1 never heard,—
Sought out our friend, and to him words addressed,
Might fire with valour even a coward's breast :
‘⁴ Go, my brave lad, where glory points the way;
Go in, and win renown, and splendid pay!
Not move? How's this ?'' And what was his reply?
A plain blunt fellow, but no fool, say Ι.
“ It doesn't suit me quite; but he, you know,
XVho's lost his purse, will where you want him go !'’

I was brought up at Rome, and there was taught
What ills to Greece Achilles’ anger wrought3
Then Athens bettered that dear lore of song;
She taught me to distinguish right from wrong,
And in the groves of Academe to sound
The way to truth, if so she might be found.
But from that spot, so pleasant and so gay,
Hard times and troublous swept my youth away
On civil war's tempestuous tide, to fight
In ranks unmeet to eope with Caesar’s might.
Whence when Philippi, with my pinions clipped,
Struck to the dust‚ of land and fortune stripped,
Turned me adrift, through poverty grown rasti,
At the versemonger's craft I made a dash.
But now, when blest with all Ι want, what wealth
Of hellebore could purge my brain to health,
XVere I not better pleased to dream and drowse,
Than with concocting verse to rack my brows ? ⁹

³* So Pope, in his imitation of this Epistle :—
⁶¹ But (thanks to Homer) since 1 live and thrive‚
Indebted to no prince or peer alive,
Sure 1 should want the care of ten Monroes.

If 1 would scribble, rather than repose.''
Dr. Monroe being the physician to Bedlam Hospital.
