HEN, blm Maecenas, shall we twain
Benoeth your stately roos a bowl

OfCaecuban long-boarded drain,

In gladsomenoes of soal,
For our great Caesar's victoni-s,

Whilsg as our caps ate cmmed,
Lym blend their Doric melodies

With fintes’ Barbarie sound ?

He, who on Rome had vowed in scorn

Themanaclestobind,
which he from faithless sex-ss had torn,

A Roman soldier, (nea, oh ne’er,
Posterity, the shame avow !)

A woman’s slave, her arms doth δατ,
And palisadoes now3 ,

Το wrinkled ennuchs cmoks the knee,
And now the sun beholds

’Midst waniors’ standards flaunting free
The vile pavilion’s solds!
