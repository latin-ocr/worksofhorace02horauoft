2 58 satire VIII. [ωσι 11.

And heads on every couch were bent
Together‚ wondering what he meant.
The whole was better sport, 1 ween,

Than any farce I've ever seen.

HORACE.

Prithee‚ go on ; what followed aster,
To further stimulate your laughter?

FUNDANIUS.

“Are all the wine-jars broke, ye louts ? ''
Vibidius to the pages shouts,
“My goblet's empty, and in vain
I cry to have it filled again! ”
Of other quips there was no dearth,
And Balatro keeps up the mirth‚
Hailing Nasidienus thus,
“ Ha! Welcome! You come back to uS,
With alteredolooks, like one that will
Repair his evil luck by skill.”

In after him some pages passed,
Who bore, upon a platter vast,
A crane, cut limb-meal, with a shower,
Soused over it, of salt and flour,

Fatted on rich figs for our use,
And leverets' shoulders, which, it seems»,
Are sweeter than their hind extremes.
Then roasted blackbirds, doves without

Their rumps, were brought-choice things, no doubt, ᾗ

surprise among the guests of Nasidienus. Why the poor sellow left the ᾗ
table for a time is afterwards explained. It is hard to say which is ,,
most contemptible, Nasidienus. or the guests who earne to eat his
dinner, and to laugh at him. The problem is one the moralist of our J
own times is often mlled upon to contemplate.
