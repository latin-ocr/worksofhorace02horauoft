Satire III. [mox ιι.

Whenever‚ sin and folly meet,

There madness is, supreme, complete.

Your villain's clearly frantie! Him‚

Whose brains in dreams of glory surim,

Bellona, whom dire hon-ors glad,

Hath with her thunders blasted mad.
Consider now—'twill not detain us-·-

Extravagance and Nomentanus 3

For lunatic‚ by reason’s rules,

We must pronounce all spendthrift fools.

No sooner did the youngsta· come

Into his property,—'twas some

Half million—there or thereabout— .

Than straight he sends an order out,

That fruita-er, fishmonger, groom,

Fowler, the man that vends perfume,

The Tusean quarter's impious crew,

The poulterer, parasites no few,

With those who cheese and mutton vend,

Should at his house betimes attend.

They came in shoals3 and for the rest

Thus spoke the pimp—“ The very best

I have, or any of us, pray,

consider as your own. To-day,

Or when you will, for it apply.’'

Now mark the youth’s discreet reply.

“ You camp out in Lucanian snow,

Au night, and in your boots, that so

I may eat wild-boar ς wintry seas

You sweep for fish. 1, lapped in mse,

Am of this wealth unworthy. 'Zounds,

You, sir, you take nine thousand pounds3

You, sir, as much 5—and you, sir‚—-come‚

No squeamishness !—there’s thrice that sum!

Your wife at any hour of night

Will come at call sor my delight.’'
