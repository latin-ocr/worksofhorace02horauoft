e 50 Notes to tlte Odes.
Latium near Amyclae and Fundi. sse wines of Cales and F aler-
num, 'like the Massic wine, were from Campania. Formiae, now
Mola di Gaeta‚ in Latium, was supposed to be the capital of the
Laestrygons. Τὴε wines of Campania, according to Pliny, were the
finest.

Of the Aristius Fuscus to whom this Ode is addressed, nothing
is known except that Horace ranks him (Satires, 1. v. 83) with
his friends Plotius, Varius, Maecenas, virgil, md others, and ad-
dressed to him the Tenth Epistle of the First Book.

In this Ode Horace condoles with Vir-gil on the death of their
friend Quinctilius Varus of Cremona, conjectured to be the same
person to whom the Eighteenth Ode of this Book is addrcssed. No
one who has lost a friend, or has a friend to lose, can read this
poem unmoved. Its pathos is genuine and profound. Quinctilius,
the sincere, the loyal friend; the upright, high-hearted gentleman,
is gone. Are we never again to see, to hold oommuning with, one
so good, so noble, so beloved? Can it be that all that some of clm-
acter, that nobility of purpose, those qualities of heast which made
him so deur, have been for ever quenched? Erg‘v Quinctr‘h'an per·
petum· sopor argu? Are they sunk into eternal sleep? Or, if not,
where are they? When such a loss as this struck them, with what .
troubled solicitude must the thoughtful souls of such men as virgil
and Horace have looked into that world aronnd whose shores the 2
dark waters of Cocytus formed a barrier which no living mariner
might cross. ,

The traces in ancient literature of a belief in a. better world ,ν
beyond the grave are few and vague. It is impossible, however, ’
that the nobler minds of Greece and Rome could bavebeen without ’
strong inward assurances that their brief and troubled career on
earth could not be the “be all and the end all ’⁹ of their existence.
The proofs os this are manifold ς bnt the sum of their creed may be
held as expressed in these lines of Propertius (Eleg. tv. 7) :—

“ Sunt aliquid Manes ,· letum non mnniafinit,
Luridaque evictas ffagit umbra rogns.”

“ The Manes are no dream 3 death closes not
Our all of being, and the wan-visaged shade
Eseapes unscathed from the suneroel fires.”
