noox ιι] Satire> V. 221

While she with you his bounties can divide,
And she’ll at him no more be terrified,
Thw mastiff-cur at a well-larded hide.

A tale there is, 'tis meet you should be told;
'nie thing occurred at Thebes, when 1 was old.
By hor last will a sly old woman there
Enjoined, that on his naked back her heir
Should bear her corpse, well smeared from head to hip
With oil; in hope, no doubt, that she would slip
Out of his flagei-s, aster she was dead,

Who, while she lived, had hung on her like lead.
Be cautious, therefore, how you stalk your game;
N either too sorward be, nor yet too tame.

Your talk if you too freely volunteer‚

It grates upon a sour and churlish ear.

Be not too silent either. Stand with head
Inchoed, betokening respectful dread,

Like Davus in the play; with oily speech
Creep into favour3 if it blows, beseech

He guard his head, a head so dear, from chil1;
Push, from a crowd to clear him, with a wilh
If he will prate, oblige him with your ear;

1f glutt'onous of praise‚ praise let him hear,
Tin, throwing up his hands to heaven, he cry

‘⁴ Hold, hold, enough! ” Yet still his soible ply,
And blow him up with phrases full of wind.

So when his death your setters shall unbind,
And terminate your years of feverish care,
And, wide awake, you hear, “ Ulysses heir

Of oue-fourth of my property Ι name !”

“0h, is he gone, my dear old chum ?'' exelaim.
“ Where shall I find a man so good, so true ? ”
And, ifyou can, squeeze out a tear or two.

In common prudence it were well, no trace

Of inward joy should show upon your face.
