398 Τ lte Art of Poetty.

In all fine work, methinks, each plays a part—-

Art linked with genius, genius linked with art;

Each doth the other's helping hand require, ,

And to one end they both, like friends, conspire.*

The youth, who in the scot-tace burns to win,

Must do and suffer much ere he begin,—

Sweat himself down, bear cold and toil and pain,

And from the lures of love and wine abstain.

At Pythian games no piper ever played

But teacher had, and was oi him afraid.

But poets nowadays don't go to school.

‘¹ Behold !'' they cry, “ my verse is wonderful.

Deuce take the hindermost ! † ’Twere foul disgrace,

Were I to be left lagging in the race,

And to confess my ignorance of what,

To tell the truth, I never have been taught ! ’⁹
Just as an auctioneer, to sell his wares,

Collects a crowd, that grins and gapes and stares,

So your rich poet round him draws a throng

Of needy flatterers to hear his song.

But if he be a poet, whose renown

For his good dinners is the talk of town,

Who bails scapegraces run to earth, and draws

Poor struggling wretches from the lawyers' claWS,

* Ben Jonson has expressed the same thought in his fine lines ‘¹ To

the memory of my beloved Mr Williarn Shakespeaoe, and what he hath
left us ι ’'—
“ Yet must 1 not give nature all ; thy art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enioy a part.
For though the poet's matter nature be.
His art doth give the fashion. And that he,
Who oests to write a living line must sweat,
(Such as thine are), and strike the second heat
Upon the Muses' anvil; tum the same,
(And himself with it) that he thinks to srame ;
Or for the laurel he may gain a scom,
For agoodpoet's made as wellas born.”

† Occupet extremum scabies. Leprosy seize the hindmost, -a phrase,
according to the scholiasts, used by boys in their races.
