Pooe grain, although he cums it all,

Choosing with bitte habs to stay

His stomach in a metched way ;

If, while his multod oellars hold

Of Chiau and Falemian old

A thousand oesks—ooe thousand! thoee!

Sour vinegar his drink shall he ς

On suar, with covalets in stote

Oscostliaet brooede, the prey

Of moths and vot-ms, some people may

Esoeem him mad,—but few are thee,

Thou god-forsaken dotard, do

You smne yourself, and pinch, and serem—

To have your son, or fioedman heir,

Waste all that you are hoaniing there?

How little, now, would it curtail

Your sum of walth, could you prevail

Upon yoursdf with better oil

To dress your salad, or the soil

Of scm-f that coats your unkempt hair

If aught vill do, why, why forswear

Yourself-why pillage, rack, and grind ?

Yon, wretched sool, you sound in mind ?

Should you to death attanpt to stone

The passas-by, οι· slaves your own

Hard oesh had bought, why, all you meet,

The very children in the street,
