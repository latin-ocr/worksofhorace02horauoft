Satire VIII.

Now it is possible to dwell
On Esquiline, and yet be well,
To saunter there and take your ease
On trim and sunny terraces,
And this where late the ground was white
With dead men’s bones, disgusting sight!
But not the thieves and beasts of prey,
Who prowl about the spot alway,
When darkness falls, have caused to me
Such trouble and anxiety‚
As those vile haga who vent the souls
Of men by spells, and poison-bowls.
Do what Ι will, they haunt the place,
And ever, when her buxom face
The wandering moon unveils, these crones

< Come here to gather herbs and bones.

Here have I seen, with streaming hair,
Canidia stalk, her feet all bare,

Her inky cloak tucked up, and howl
With Sagana, that beldam foul.

The deadly pallor of their face

With sear and horror filled the place.
Up with their nails the earth they threw;
Then limb-meal tore a coal—black ewe,
And poured its blood into the hole,

So to evoke the shade and soul

Of dead men, and from these to wring
Responses to their questioning.

Two effigies they had,—of wool

WVas one, and one of wax3 to rule

The other and with pangs subdue,

The woouen larger of the two;

The waxen cowered like one that stands
Beseeching in the hangman’s hands.
