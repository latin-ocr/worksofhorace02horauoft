EPODE V11.
To THE ROMAN PEoPLE.

ΑΗ, whither would ye, dyed in guilt, thus headlong rusb?
Or why

Grasp your right hands the battle-brands so recently laid by?

Say, can it be, upon the sea⁷ or yet upon the shore,

That we have poured too sparingly our dearest Latian gore?

Not that yon envious Carthage her haughty towers should see

To flames devouring yielded up by the sons of Italy ;

Nor that the Briton‚ who has ne'er confessed our prowess, may

Descend, all gyved and manacled, along the Sacred Way,

But that our Rome, in answer to Parthia's prayer and moan,

Should by our hands, her children's hands, be crushed and
overthrown ?

Alas Ε alas l More fell is ours than wolves' or lions’ tage,

For they at least upon their kind no war unholy wage !

What power impels you? Fury blind, or demon that would
wreak

Revenge sor your blood-guiltiness and crimes ? Make answerl

. Speak l

They’re dumb, and with an ashy hue their cheeks and lips
are dyed,

And stricken through with conscious guilt their souls are
stupefied!

'Tis even so; relentless fates the sons of Rome pursue,

And his dread crime, in brother’s blood who did his hands-
imbrue ;

For still sor vengeance from the ground calls guiltless Remus’v
gore,

By his descendants’ blood to be atoned sor evermore !
