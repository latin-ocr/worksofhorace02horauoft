302 To Bullatius. [mox 1.

Of all the towns of Attalus can you

Name any one you’ve ta'en a fancy to ?

Sick-tired os rugged roads and stormy seas,

Do you find Lebedus a place to please ἓ

“ You know what Lebedus* is like? ” “ More dead

Than Gabii or Fidenae, 1 have read.”

“Yet there I'd like to live, were such my lot,

My friends sorgetting, by ιη friends sorgot‚

XVhere I may watch in safety from the shore

The wrath of foaming seas, and hear them roar.”†
But surely, friend, the man who gains an inn,

Besplashed with mud, and soaking to the skin,

When on his way from Capua to Rome.

Will not desire to make that inn his home ς

Nor he, who catches cold, the praises sing

Of baths and hot stoves, as the only thing

To make the sum of human bliss complete.

Why, then, should you, because you’ve had to beat

About at sea before a stiffish breeze,

Sell off your yacht across the Egean seas?

of the five ruined cities os Ionia. Horace had in his youth most prob-
ably seen them all, and. as Charles Lamb preferred Fleet Strcet and
the Strand to Skiddaw and all the glories of the Lake country, so he

obviously thought the Campus Martius and the banks of the Tiber Α

better than them all.
⁴ Lebedus was also in Ionia. It had been laid waste by Lysimachus,

when he hemme master of the western part of Asia Minor, aster the ,

battle of Ipsus (8.0. 3οι), and had probably become a poor tumble-down
place when Horace saw it. as he no doubt did during his campaign with
Brutus. Gabii was an ancient and deoeyed town of Latium, about
twelve miles from Rome. Fidenae, about five mila from Rome, shaoed
its character for dulness and desolation.

† The only reasonable solution of the passage we have placed in
inverted commas is. that Bullatius had expressed himself to this effect
in some letter to Horace, and that upon this hint Horace speaks, telling
him that solitude. fine scenery, and stormy sas. are all very well, hut

they are soercely a sufficient reason sor giving up all the pleasuroe and ⁵>

companionship of a home in the metropolis.
