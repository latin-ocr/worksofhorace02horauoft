Penelopes suitors. losel knavoe. our main

Delight good living, like Alcinous’ train,*

Who thought no shame to lie abed till noon,

And <lance their cares off to a minstrel’s tune.
Rogues rise o' nights men’s lives and gold to take:

will you, to 'scape perdition, not awake ἲ

Ῑί when you're well you will not, you'll be sain.

When dropsy eomes, to run, but then in vain.

So, long οη dawn unless your lamp be lit,

And you o'er some well-chosen volume sit,

Nerving your soul with knowledge and the love

Of thoughts that list a man himself above‚†

Emry’s sharp pangs or love's disuaeting throes

will many a night forbid your eyes to close.

Let but a speck of dust distress your eye,

You rest not till you're rid of it3 then why.

15 ’tis your mind that's out of sorts. will you

Put off the cure with ‘⁸ Any time will do ” ?

Make a good start. and you are sure to win.

So. then, have eourage to be wise! Regin Ξ

He that would mend his life, yet still delays

To set to work, is like the boor who stays

'rill the broad stream that bars his way is gone,

But on still flows the stream, and ever will flow on.
Of course there’s always some excuse to plead.
