Our grave and reverend seniors would exclaim.

Thatlwaslosttoeverysenseofshame.

For trying to pick holos in what the staid

AEsopus and the learned Roscius played ς’

Because, belike, they hold that nought is good.

But what has pleased their own peculial· moed.

Or else because they deem it shame and siti

'ro men so much their juniors to give in,

Owning that what they learned as beardless boys

Should in ripe years be dropped as antiquated toys.

Which are the light and sweetness of our homes?
