Not every one has skill to hit the blot,

And tell if lines be musical or not,

And all we Romans to our poets are

In this respect too merciful by far.

But shall I therefore let my style run loose

In lines ill-jointed, lumbering, diffuse, ·

Content to think, though all will see my faults‚

Not more than other men's my measure halts?

No Ξ At the best I might escape from blame:

But praise—to that should ne'er make good a claim.
Do you, my friends, from Greece your models

draw,

And day and night to con them be your law?

Our ancestors, 'tis true, rough, easy folks,

Praised Plautus’ numbers as they praised his jokes,—

In so admiring showing, I admit,

Of patience much, but some small lack of wit;

At least, is you and 1 the difference know

'Twixt bright keen wit and humour coarse and low,

And by our fingers and our ears can tell

When verses run harmonionsly and well.
’Twas Thespis first, they say, broke tragic ground,

And hawked in caravans his plays around,

Wherein his troop, their faces daubed with lees, .

With chant and action did their best to please.

Then AEschylus devised the mask and pall.

Built up a solid stage, but kept it small,—

A nobler strain os declamation taughtst

And into use the stately buskin brought.

Then came the elder comedy, which was

Not without merit—won, too. much applause:

But when its freedom into licence grew,

And law stepped in, its rancour to subdue,

Stripped of the privilege to stab and sting,

The chorus, shame to say, no more would sing.
