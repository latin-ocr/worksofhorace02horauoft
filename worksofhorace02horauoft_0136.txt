122 Satira III. Β [noox 1.

Were you a king? Absurd! If it be true,
That whosoe'er is wise is wealthy too,
An excellent shoemaker, and that he
Alone of men is beautiful to see,
A king in fine, why do you wish for what
Is yours already? This, you say, is not
The true intent of Sire Chrysippus’ viewsst
“A sage‚ though he ne’er made his boots and shoes,
Is still a sage at making shoe or boot.''
But how? “Just as Hermogenes,† though mute,
Is a fine singer and musician sti113
Just as astute Alfeniusss kept the skill
To handle brad and lapstone‚ since the day
He shut up shop, and threw his awl away,

school, that all offences against the law were equally criminal, and
should be punished with equal severity. Cicero ‘de Finibus,’ tv. xix.
35. states it thus: “Recte facta omnia aqualia, omnia peccataparia,”
—a doctrine, as he says, very showy at first sight, but utterly unsound
and contrary to common-sense. Horace, having dealt with one extrava-
gance of this sect, proceeds to ridicule another, to wit. that a wize man
was potentially master of all knowledge, all excellence, all power. In

one of the fragments of Lucilius this proposition is stated* m almost the
words of Horace: —

“ln mundo sapiens haec omnia habebit,-
Formosus, dives, liber, rex, solus vocetur?

¹· All these things shall the sage have here on earth:
Let none but he be called sur-passing fair,
Waelthy and free.—he is the only king.'’

Horace refers again to this notion at the end of the First Epistle of the*
F irst Book.

⁴* Chrysippus. b9n'1 at Soli in Cilicia, 280 Rc. He suceeeded Clean-
thes, the successor os Zeno, in the Stoic school.

† Hermogenes Tigellius, a teacher of music, to whom Horace appa-
rently had a dislike. He mentions him again in the next Satine, and
also in the ninth of this book.

Ξῖ Alfenius, a shoemaker of Cremona, who is said to have afterwards

become a lawyer of eminence, and to have even attained the honours of γ

the consulship.
