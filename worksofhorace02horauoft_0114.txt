100 To Apollo and Diana.

And oh! may He, the Seer divine,
God of the fulgent bow,
Phoebus, beloved of the Muses nine,
Who sor the body racked and worn with woe
By arts remedial finds an anodyne,
If he with no unloving eye doth view
The crested heights and halls os Palatine,
On to a lustre new
Prolong the weal of Rome, the blest estate
Of Latium, and on them, long ages through,
Still growing honours, still new joys accumulate !

And may She, too, who makes her haunt

On Aventine and Algidus alway,
May She, Diana, grant
The prayers, which duly here
The Fisteen Men upon this sestal day
To her devoutly send,
v And to the youth's pure adjurations lend

No unpropitious ear Ξ

Now homeward we repair, ·
Full of the blessed hope, that will not fail,
That Jove and all the gods have heard our prayer,
And with approving smiles our homage hail,—
We skilled in choral hannonies to raise
The hymn to Phoebus and Diana’s praise.
