376 Tlce A rt of Poetty.

A vase was meant; how comes it, then, about.
As the wheel turns, a common jug comes out?
Whate’er you write, by this great maxim run,
Let it be simple, homogeneous, one.

WVe poetS, most of us, by the pretence,

Dear friends, are duped of seeming excellence.
We grow obscure in striving to be tense:
Aiming at ease, we enervate our verse;

For grandeur soaring, into bombast fall,

And, dreading that, like merest reptiles eraw13
Whilst he, who seeks his readers to surprise
With common things shown in uncommon wisc,
will make his dolphins through the forests roam,
His wild boars ride upon the billows' soam.

So unskilled writers, in their haste to shun

One fault, are apt into a worse to run.

The humblest statuary, of those that nigh

The AEmilian Circus ἥ their vocation ply,

A finger-nail will to a turn express,

And hit you off in bronze a flowing tress—

Yet is his work a sailure ; for his soul

Can neither grasp nor mould a living whole.

In anything that I may ever write,

Ι would no more resemble such a wight

Thau 1 would care to have dark hair, dark eyeS,
If coupled with a nose of uncouth size.

All ye who labour in the Muses· bowers,
Select a theme proportioned to your powers,
And ponder long, and with the nicest care,
How much yo‘ur shoulders can and cannot bear.
Once right in this, your words will sreely flow,
And thought from thought in lucid order grow.

⁴* AEmilium circa ludum. It is not quite clear whether a circm is
maem, or merely a gymnasium or gladiators' school—very pmbwly
the latter, not sar from the Forum, in some ¹¹ artists’ quarter.''
