46 Notes to tlte odes.

There be garlands, where the violet mingling with the crocus blows,

Chaplets of the saffron twining through the blushes of the rose5

Lilies, too, which Aeheloes shall in wicker baskets bring,

Lilies fresh and sparkling, newly dipped within some virgin spring.

There are little cheeses also, laid between the verdant rushes,

Yellow plums, the bloom upon them, which they took from Au-
tumn's blushes 3

Chestnuts‚ apples ripe and rosy, cakes which Ceres might appland;

Why should we reserve these fragrant garlands sor the thankless
dust ?

XVould ye that their sweets were gathered sor the monumental bust? ’

VVine there !—W'ine and dice l—To-morrow’s sears shall fools alone
