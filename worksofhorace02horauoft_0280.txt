266 To Moecenas. [⁸003 1.

Glycon ‘¹' in thews may beat you out and out.
Shall you not, therefore, keep at bay the gout?
Fair wisdom's goal may not be reached, but you ⁴,
May on the road advance a stage or two·
Say, is your bosom ravaged by the fire
Of sateless avarice or of foul desire ?
Maxims there are and spells, the pain can ease.
And purge away nine-tenths of your diseased·
Art mad for same? Through yonder volume spell
Again and yet again, and you'll be well.
However coarse in grain a man may be,
Drone, brawler, makebate‚ drunkard, debauehee,
A patient ear to culture let him lend,
He's sure to turn out gentler in the end.
To fly from vice is virtue, says the sage,
Not to be soolish, wisdom's earliest stage;
The ills that mortals dread of ills the most,—
To be hard up, or in preferment crossed,-
To ’scape these, mark, what will not men go through,
What toil and stress of brain and body too?
Chased by the sear of poverty behind,
Away you post, to trade with sarthest Iud.
O’er rocks and seas, through tropic heats‚ and turn
From the wise friend with stolid unconcern.

⁵ It is a nice question with the critics whether Glycon was {celebrated
athlete of the day, or the famous statue now known as the Famae Her-
cules, which was the work os Glycon, a sculptor os Athens. whose nme
is carved on the rock on which Hercules rests hIs elub. 'nne statue
was greatly admired‚ a copy of it was impressed οιι the money of
Athens, audit was no doubt familiar in copies to the contemporaries
os Horace in Rome. It was brought there by Caracalla, and placed in
the baths that bore his name, among the ruins os which it was found in

Qui peuvent de notre ame assoupir 1oe blesum,
Et de magiques chants qui tax-issent les plenus?
