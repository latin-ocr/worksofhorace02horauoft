77ae Art ofPoetry. 375

Weu. trust me. Pisos. os that srmk os art

The book would be the very counterpart,

Which with a medley os wild sancies teems.

Whirling in chaos like a sick man's dreams,

A maze of forms incongruous and base,

Where nought is os a piece, nought in its place?
To dare whate'er they please has always been

The painters. poet's, privilege, 1 ween.

It is a boon that any one may plead— ³

Myself 1 claim it, and in turn concede:

But ‘twill not do to urge the plen too far. ‚e

To j0in together things that clash and jar,

The savage with the gentle, were absurd.

Or couple lamb with tiger, snake with bird.
Mostly, when poems open with a grand

Imposing air, we may sui-mise at hand

Some flashy fustian, here and there a patch

Of flaming smrlet, meant the eye to catch.

A grove shall be described, or Dian's shrine,

Or through delightsome plains sor many a line

A brook shall wind, or the Rhine’s rushing stream,

Or o'er the page the hoevenly bow shall gleam.

All very fine, but wholly out of place Ξ 'r

Yon draw a cypress with consummate grace:

But what of that, is you have had your see

To paint a wrecked man struggling in the soe?‡
