»σοι ι] Satire VI. 141

Ἠιο mob with state this same Laevinus crown,
And thrust the great though low-born Decius down
Or from the senate though 1 must retire,
At Censor Appins' hint, because my sire
Was maenly born ?—and rightly, since 'tis clear

Question on question buzz about his ears;

That aims, like Barrus there, to sbine, of beaus
The pink and paragon, where'er he goes
Provokes the girls to scan with curious care
His features, bust‚ limbs, feet, and teeth, and hair;
So he that to the care of Rome aspires,
Of Romans, Italy, her temples' fires,
Her boundless empiry, perforce constrains
An men to ask, and ask with anxious pains,
Who was his sire, or is a mother’s name,
Noteless herself, mark him unknown to fame?

Say, son of Syrus, wouldst thou dare, or thou,

The son of Dionysius, from the brow
Of the Tarpeian hurl the sons of Rome,
Or hand them over to the headsman's doom?
“Well! but my colleague Novius‚” you reply,
“Is one degree still lower down than 1.
