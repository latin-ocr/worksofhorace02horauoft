Satire III.

Tvofarmstheywue—and ereheffied,
Callingtheboys nohisbedside,
“Q”hem4“sincefitst Isaw
You thrust your phythings, dice or ην,
looselyintoyourbroest, andplay,

While with grave looks, Tiberius, you
Conntedandhid them out oflviev,

You following Nomentanus, you
Cicuta, that usurious seur. -
Wherefore 1 charge you both, by all
Gods and Pennus, grat and small,
τὼ.- ιιωᾱςς-γω, that you lesen not,

Your fither thinks enough sor you,
And nature wisely stints you to.
That you by pride, nereum, may
Be never tickled, thus 1 lay

My ban on you: Should eitherbe
AEdile or Praetor, then may he

Stand aye accurst! What! waste your means

On largesses of pulse and benus-„¹L
That you may through the circus pass
With statelier stalk, or stand in brass,

Base, madman, of your money, bare ‚

oryour patemal actes fair?
Oryou, forsooth, the plaudits gain,
That daily on Agrippa rain,—

You, aping‚ with a foxlike art,

The lion of the noble hart?
