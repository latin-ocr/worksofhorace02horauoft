2 16 Satire V. [Boot 11.

And well you know, unless with fortune backed,
That birth and hrains are nought—mere dross, in fact.

TIRESIAS.
Since you so candidly your dread avow
Of being poor, let me instruct you, how
You may grow rich. A gift, we’ll say, is sent,
Of fieldfares, or some other dainty, meant
For your own private tooth ; despatch it straight,
Where some old dotard dwells in lordly state.
Fine apples, all your garden’s choicest fruit,
These should some rich man’s palate first salute ς
The Lares can come aster, as they may,*
For he is more to be revered than they.
Though he's a perjurer, fifty times forsworn,
Puddle in blood, and in the gutter born,
With brother’s gore still reeking on his hand,
A runaway, that bears a felon’s brand,
If he to walk with him on you shall eall,
You go, of course, and yield him, τοο, the wau.

ULYSSES.
1 hold his skirts up ί Ι precedence waive
To a low mongreL a flagitious slave Ξ
Not thus I bore myself at Troy, where 1
&Vas with my betters proudly wont to vie.

TIRESIAS.
Then you'll be poor.

ULYSSES.
So be it Ξ Ι shall steel

My soul to brook the shame, and not to feel.

ἃ The Roman revered none of his gods more than his Lares, whose ff>
images stood in his hall, and who were invoked and sacrifice made'to
them at his meals. To them the first—fmus were always offered.
