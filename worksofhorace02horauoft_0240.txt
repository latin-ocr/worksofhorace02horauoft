226 Satira VL , [mox 11.

“ Do get Maecenas, do, to sign
This application here of mine! ’²
‘⁴ Well, well, I'll try.'’ “ You can with ease
Arrange it, if you only please.²’

Close on eight years it now must be,
Since first Maecenas numbered me
Among his friends, as one to take
Out driving with him, and to make
The confidant of trifles‚ say,
Like this, “ What is the time of day?’'
“The Thracian Bantam‚ would you bet
On him, or on the Syrian Pet?’'
‘⁴ These chilly mornings will do barm,
If one don’t mind to wrap up warm3 '’
Such nothings as without a sear
One drops into the chinkiest ean*
Yet all this time hath envy's glance
On me looked more and more askance.
From mouth to mouth such comments run: Ι
“ Our friend indeed is Fortune’s son.
Why, there he was, the other day,
Beside Maecenas at the play3
And at the Campus, just before,
They had a bout at battledore.”

Some chilling news through lane and street
Spreads from the Forum. All I meet

quarters, they were anxious he should attend a meeting in which some
matter of importance to the intere-{ts of the body was to be discussed.
ἢ* Compare with this the familiar lines of Terence (Eun. 1. ii. 23 ct ., ,

πᾳ.) .—- ¹¹ Quoe vera audt'vi, tucca, et contineo optime,-

Sinfizlsum . . .
Plenus rimarum sum, Ιιαι· atque illac pertinax·

⁴¹ Trust me with facts, and I'm as close as wan
But sor mere gossip fabulous and false,
1 am all chink, and leak at every pore-''
