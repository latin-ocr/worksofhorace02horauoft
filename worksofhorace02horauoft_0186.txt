172 Satire. I. - [mox 11.

TREBATIUS.

Wants any man sound sleep, let him

Three times across the Tiber swim

With limbs well oiled, and soak his skin
With wine, ere he to bed tum in.

Or, if needs must that you should write,
Why then essay a daring ssight!

Great Caesar sing, and his campaign,
Where praise and padding wait your strain.

HORACE.

Most worthy sir, that‘s just the thing

I’d like especially to sing,

But at the task my spirits faint;

For ’tis not every one can paint
Battalions, with their bristling wall

of pikes, or make you see the Gaul,

With shivered spear, in death-throe bleed,
Or Parthian stricken from his steed.

TREBATIUS.

But why not sing—this much you could—
His‘ justice and his fortitude,

Like sage Lucilius, in his lays

To Scipio Africanus’ praise?

HORACE.

When time and circumstance suggest,
1 shall not fail to do my best ;

But never words of mine shall touch
Great Caesar's ear, but only such

As are to the occasion due,

And spring from my conviction‚ too.
