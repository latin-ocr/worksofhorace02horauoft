noox 1.] satire III. 1 2 1

‘riu they invented language to express
Their thoughts and feelings: then grew less and less

The tage of war ς walled towns began to fise,
And laws were framed to appal and to chastise
Thieves, robbers, and adulterers. For before
Fair Helen’s days had woman drenched in gore
Both men and nations. But the lusty wights,
Who, brutelike‚ wildly snatching love’s delighss,
Were slain by him who topped them all in might
Like the prime bull that lords the herd, from sight
< Have vanished in the shade of death's engulfing night.
Whoe'er explores and follows to their source

The annals of the past must own, persoree,
That in the dread of wrong laws had their rise.
For nature is not by mere instinct wise
To choose 'twixt wrong and right, ’twixt good and ill,
As she distinguishes with inborn skill
Betwixt what things are wholesome, what are not,
What should by all be shunned, and what be sought ς
Nor will our reason e'er be brought to rate
His crime the‘ same in essence, and as great,
who from his neighbour’s garden steals some pods,
As his, who robs the temples of the gods.
Then to devise some rule should be our care,
Which to the crime the punishment shall square,
Lest he, whose fault a stinging birch might purge,
Be flayed alive by the infernal scourge.
For that you shall with a mere whipping chide
The rogue who should at least be erucified,
1 have no sear, though you maintain, ’tis quite

⁴ As bad to steaJ, as break a house by night;
And vow, were you a king, that you would strike

’ At gmt offenders and at small alike.⁴¹·
