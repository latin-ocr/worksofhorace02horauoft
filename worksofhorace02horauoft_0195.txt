noox ιι] Satira II. ’ 1 8 1

what wine from the chin of his cellar emerges—
’T is a drop at the beet—has the flavour of verjuice3
While from a huge cruet his own sparing hand
On his eoleworts drops oil, which no mox-tal ean stand,
’ . So utterly rancid and loathsome in smell, it
Defies his sule vinegar even to quell it.
What style, then, of lise will a wise man pursue,
And his model, say, which shall it be of the two?
Is, on this side, the wolf, as the adage runs, scare you,
The dog upon that side is waiting to tear you.
The proper thing is to be cleanly and nice,
And yet so as not to be over-precise3 ’
Το neither be constantly scolding your slaves,
Like that old prig Albutus, as losels and knaves,
Nor in such things, like Naevius, rather too easy,
To the ἕαδε at your board present water that's greasy.
Now laern, in what way and how greatly you'll gain
By using a diet both spating and plain.
First, your health will be good; sor you readily can
Believe, how much mischief is done to a man
By a great mass of disheQ—remembering that
Plain fare of old times, and how lightly it sat.
ὲ But the moment you mingle up boiled with roast meat,
λ - And shellfish with thrushes, what tasted so sweet
· will be turned into bile, and ferment, not digest, in
Your stomach exciting a tumult intestine.
Mark, from a bewildering· dinner how pale
Α Every man rises up! N or is that all they ail,
’ For the body, weighed down by its last night’s excesses,
η Το its own wretched level the mind too depresses,
And to earth chains that spark of the essence divine3
.. j.> While he that’s content on plain viands to dine,
, Sleeps off his fatigues without effert, then gay
² 5 As a lark rises up to the tasks of the day.
