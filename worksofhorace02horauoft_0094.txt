80 Notes to tlte Odes.

too sedulous a devotion to what, in Horace’s philosophy, was only a
“busy idlenoes‚'' and that ambition os walth which is apt to creep
insidiously but surely on those who throw themselves mlously
into a professional career. This much may be inserted both from
this Ode and from the Epistle in question, one of the most charm-
ing of its class, and especially interesting from the light it throws
upon the interior of the poet’s establishment. It is pleasant, as
Wieland observes, to see the poet so attentive to all the little
domestic details, and pluming himself so heartily upon the purity
os his table sumiture, and the brightness of his cups and dishes.

himself. Choice persumes were as indispensable to a Romau’s enjoy-
ment of a feast as choice wines. They were costly, and Horace re-
quires Virgil to contribute this part to the essentials ostheir earonse.
Catullus, in much the same strain, invites his sn‘end Fabullus to
‹linner‚ promising to find the persume, on condition that Fabullus
brings with him all the other requisites.

The use of pei-sumes, which the Romans learned from the
Eastems, was carried by them to excesS. No banquet was com·
plete without them. Egypt, India, Arabia, yielded the choicest
spices sor their manufacture, which was carried to perfection at
Rome. The native plants of Italy-the lily, the iris, the narcissus,
sweet marjoram, &c.-—were also extensively employed. The reses of

Paestum, biferi rosaria Pccstt’, and of Phaselis and Campania, were κ
