348 To Augustus. [mox n.

When, testing from long years of warsare, Greece
Began to cultivate the arts of peace,
And, in the sunshine of unclouded hours,
Dropped from her nerveless grasp her noblest powers.
On athletes now, and now on steeds she poured
The fervour of her passion, now adored
Statues m marble, bronze, and ivory wrought.
Or pored on pictures in ecstatic thought;
VVas now all mad for music, sparkling bright,
Now in the grave tragedians took delight;
Just like the child, who with its nurse at play
Discards to-morrow what it sought to-day.
Likings, dislikings, whims of mere caprice,
These were the fruits of luxury and peace.

At Rome 'twas long our sashion and our pride,
By dawn to be about,—fling open wide
The doen—see clients, coach them in the law,—
Put money. out on bonds without a flaw,
And covered by good names—from reverend men
To learn, and tell the younger folks again
What ways were best our fortunes to amend,
And curb desires that in destruction end.
Mark now, how changed the spirit of our age Ξ
’Tis writing‚ writing now is all the rage ;
Boys and grave fathers crown their brows with bays. ’
And as they sit at supper spout their lays.
Even Ι, who vow I never write a line,
The Parthians in mendacity outshine‚
Awake before the sun is up, and call
For pen and parchment, writing-case and all.
'Where is the man will undertake to steer,
XVho's strange to ships, and all their sailing gear?
Who ventures to administer a draught‚
Without due training in the doctor‘s craft?
