To Cassius chkrus.

But you, when you have made th& wood
With bark and belloving shake,

Is any thies shall ssing you sood,
The filthy bribe viu take.

Bevaoe, hevam! For evermooe
1 hold such knaves in scorn,

And bear, their wretched sides to gore,
A sharp and mdy hom;

“ What! Ifaehurlshansnapatme,

And paster and moy,
shall 1 sit down contentedly‚
And blubber like a boy ?
