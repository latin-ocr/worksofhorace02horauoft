tions he has been accustomed to connect with the Campagm, The
scream of the engine sounds strangely' in that place of graves, under
whose grassy undulations lie many generations of the ‘⁶ rerum
domini‚” and the countless villages, tombs, and stateiy villas which
erewhile crowded that now lonely and unpeopled and silent region.
But let the sky be bright and the air clear and sharp, and ‘⁶ earth
has not anything to show more sair '¹ than the landseape which
stretches before and around him as the tramway car bears him
pleasantly across the Campagna. In front of him is the panonnia
of the Alban and Sabine hilis, with their exquisitely broken line of
summits, sading into the mists and swept by the flying shadows of
the clouds. To the lest he will see swelling from the plain the pic-
turesque heights of Mentana, Mondcelli, and Palumbum, and still
sarther to the lest Soracte rising solitary on the horizon. 'As the car
grinds along the Via Tiburtina, the same that Horace has so osten
traversed on his mule with his saddle·bags flapping at its sides, he

impressive stiuness with the life and bustle of the Augustam days.
Soercely a trace remains os the houses and monuments with which

hydrogen, and giving to the air a highly Stygiam fragrance, as they

pass in a strong current from Lake Soifatara across the rond into a
new bathing establishment‚ will, it is true, remind‚him of the Roman ’“

delight in baths of all kinds. But the only monuments of antiquity

of any consequence which he will pass arose long after Horace's ⁴*

time.

These are—the enormous vilia of Hadrian, the mins of which he ³2
will see peeping out among the olive-trees and the cypressos on the ¹- ,
right, and the stately monument of the Plautia family, which over- ,

hangs the road, flanked by an ostem‘a os the homeliest kind. The
same rare good fortune which has preserved the similar but more

imposing tomb of Cecilia Metella on the Appian Way hasproeerved ‘3
from the ravages os barbarians, ancient and medem, thisresting·phoe ’
of a man famous in his time. This was the Consul Titus Plautius ξ
Silvanus, who served successively under Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, ζ

perhaps survive his tomb, as one of those brave generals and able j
