1 14 Satire II. [noox 1.

A fellow that with special haste is posting to the dogs,
However hard his pace may be, that fellow's pace he jogs3
And casts about to get the bonds, or, better, bills at sight,
Of youngsters just os age, who groan, their fathers keep them
tight.
Who, told of this, would not exclaim, “ Great Jove l But
then, no doubt,
He screws out all he can to meet his costly goings out?”
Not he. In fact, you’d scarce believe the miserable way
He stints himself of all delights: the father in the play, .
Whom, after driving out his son, in wretched plight we see,
Did not excruciate himself more ruthlessly than he.
And now should any ask—‘⁴ The drift of this?” 1 then reply,
Fools shunning faults at one extreme, off to the other fly.
Malthinus shuffies down the street, his robe about his heels,
Another tucks his up, till what he should not he revenh
Rufillus smells all pouncet-box, Gargonius stinksall goat ς
No medium’s kept.
