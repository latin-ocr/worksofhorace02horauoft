386 T lte Art of Poetry.

Progne must not a swallow’s semblance take.
Nor Cadmus be transformed into a snakes*
If things like these before my eyes be thrust‚
1 turn away in sceptical disgust.

Five acts a play must have, nor more nor less,
To keep the stage and have a marked success,
Let not a god come in, save to untie
Some knot that will his presence justisy;
Confine your speaking parts upon the scene.
To three—a fourth should never intervene.†

The chorus' place and sunction is alway
To “ prove a busy actor in the play ; ” :t
And what they chant between the acts should blend
Well with the plot, and help towards its end.
Let them· support the good with counsel sage‚
Cheer those that sear to sin, calm those that rage,
Extol the srugal meal, the weal that dates·
From justice, laws, and peace with unbarred gates,
No secrets blab, and pray the gods to crown ’
The oppressed with wealth, and bring the oppress-»ors Α

down. J

s The fffe‘of yore was not, as now, brass-bound, .

⁵ '⁷ Nor aimed to emulate the trumpet’s sound ;

’Twas slender, and its stops were few and plain,
Yet it gave value to the choral strain,

And its thin notes could penetrate along
Benches not crowded by too great a throng,-—-

⁴* Progne, the daughter of Pandion, King of Attica, was turned into
a swallow, say some, into a nightingale, say others. Cadmus, oppressed
with old age and sorrow. prayed the gods to release him from the
miseries os his life. He and his wife Harmonia were turned into ser-
pents (Ovid, Met. iv. 563 et seq.)

†A very usesul mle sor theatres so large, that a grat part os the'
audience could not hear what was passing on the stage. and where the
action was therefore sure to become confused if many characters were
introduced. But it has no foundation in the nature of things.
