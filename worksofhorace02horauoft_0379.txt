And gnash my teeth in impetent despair.

There lived in Argos once 3 well-born cit,
Who in the empty theetre would sit,
Applauding stoutly‚ and with raptare stirred
At woudmus dramaS, which he thought he heard3

A kindly neighbour‚ 3 most genial host,
As husband gentle, and as master mild,

You’ve robbed me of my plmures, torn away
The sweet illusion made my life so gay !”⁴¹·
