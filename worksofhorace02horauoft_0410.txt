Tlte A rt os Poetry.

Yet each of these in his own way will please. v
Get reputation—nay‚ get handsome sees:

But gods, and men, and booksellers refuse

To countenance a mediocre Muse.

As at a feast, strains dissonant and hoarse,

A nauseous sweetmeat, or an unguent coarse,
Are odious—just because there is no call

To have such dainties for a feast at all—

So verse, whose aim and end is to delight,
Will, if it miss persecfion, fail outright.

You do not find men, never trained to wield-
The arms of pastime, show in Mars's Field.
They stand aloos, while others fling the disc,
Or strike the ball or hoop, and dread to risk
The jeers and laughter of the gazers there:

Yet any fool to scribble verse will dare-'¹¹'

“And wherefore not?’' 1 hear some one exclainn
“Is he not sree, of a good stock and name„

His morals flawless, and his fortune quite

Up to the mark expected in a knight?”

You, well I know, will never say or do

But what your natural genius prompts you to.†
still, if you shall hereaster find your pen

Stray into poetry, I’d have you then

Try its effect on critic Tarpa's ears,‡

Then on your sire's and mine, and good nine years
Keep it shut closely up in your scrutore.

While ’tis unpublished, you can blot and score;
But words once spoken come back nevermore.

ὕ Horace had already expressed the same idea (Epist. 11. 1, 114)—
Navim agere ignarus, navim timet, &a See p. 348, ante.

† Tu nihil invita dices faciesve Alinerva. Cicero, de Off, 1. 31· κιο,
speaks of this as a commoh colloquial phrase ε “Invita. ut aiunt,
[Miner-va, id cst, adversante et repugnante natura.''
