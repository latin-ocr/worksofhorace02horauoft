A lplcz'ns. [Epona ιι.

But when grim winter comes, and b’er his grounds
Scatters its biting snows with angry roar,

He takes the field, and with a cry of hounds
Hunts down into the toils the soaming boar;

Or seeks the thrush, poor starveling, to ensnare,
In filmy net with bait delusive stored,

Eutraps the travelled crane, and timorous hare,
Rare dainties these to glad his srugal board.

Who amid joys like these would not forget

The pangs which love to all its victims bears,
The sever of the brain, the ceaseless fret,

And all the heart’s lamentings and despairs?

But if a chaste and blooming wife, beside,

His cheersul home with sweet young blossoms fills,
Like some stout Sabine, or the sunburnt bride

Of the lithe peasant of the Apulian hius,

Who piles the hearth with logs well dried and old
Against the coming of her wearied lord,

And, when at eve the cattle seek the sold,
Drains their fun udders of the milky hoard ;

And bringing forth from her well-tended store
A jar of wine, the vintage of the year,

Spreads an'unpurchased feast‚-oh then, not more
Could choicest Lucrine oysters give me cheer,

Or the rich turbot, or the dainty char,
If ever to our bays the winter’s blast

Should drive them in its sury from afar ;
Nor were to me a welcomer repast
