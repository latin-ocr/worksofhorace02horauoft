Tlce PVitcltes' Orgy. [arone v.

Her long sharp unpared thumb-nail. Wha}
Then said she? Yea, what said she not?

“ Ο Night and Dian, who with true
And friendly eyes my purpose view,
And guardian silence keep, whilst 1
My secret orgies safely ply,
Assist me now, now on my soes
With all your wrath celestial close!
Whilst, stretched in soothing sleep, amid
Their forests grim the beasts lie hid,
May all Suburra's mongrels bark
At yon old wretch, who through the dark
Doth to his lewd encounters crawl,
And on him draw the jeers of all Ξ
He's with an ointment smeared, that is
My masterpiece. But what is this?
Why, why should poisons brewed by me
Less potent than Medea’s be,
By which, for love betrayed, beguiled,
On mighty Creon’s haughty child
She wreaked her vengeance sure and swift‚
And vanished, when the robe, her gift,
In deadliest venom steeped and dyed,
Swept off in flame the new-made bride?
No herb there is, nor root in spot
However wild, that 1 have not ;
Yet every common harlot’s bed
Seerris with some rare Nepenthe spread,
For there he lies in swinish drowse,
Of me obhvious, and his vows !
He is, aha ! protected well
By some more skilful witch’s spell Ξ
But, Varus, thou (doomed soon to know
The raek of many a pain and woe !)
