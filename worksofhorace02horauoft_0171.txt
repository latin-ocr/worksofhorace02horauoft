‘ro-day though driven from his gate,
what matter? 1 will lie in vait,
To catch some lueky chance ; 1⁷11 meet,
3 Or munke him in the street ς
1’11 haunt him like his shadow! Nougbt
³ In life without much ton is bought.”
ἶ Just at this moment who but my
ὲ Dear friend Aristius ¹¹* should come by?
ἢ My ratae-braia right well he knew.

ι Heasksandanswexs. Whilstweran
The usual com-tedes, 1 began
To pluck him by the sleeve‚ to pinch
His arms», that feel but will not fliuch,
By nods aud winks most plain to see
Imploring him to roecue me:
He, wickedly obtuse the while,
Meets all my signals with a smile.
1, choked with tage, said, “ Was there not
some business, I’ve forgotten what,
Yon mentioued, that you wished with me
To talk about, and privately ?''

‘⁴ Oh, 1 remember! Never mind
some more convenient time 1²11 find.
The Thirtieth Sabbath this! would you
Offend the circumcised Jew ? ”
