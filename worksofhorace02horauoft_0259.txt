 

Satire VII.

And this old sinner, never nice,

And steeped consistently in vice,

Is much less wretched every way
Thau that poor Priscus, who to-day
Strives hard to curb his passions, then
Next morning gives them head again.

Rascal, will you ne’er come to what
These saws of yours are pointed at ?

You’re praising up incessantly ,
The habits, manners, likings, ways
Of people in the good old days-
Yet should some god this moment give
To you the power like them to live,
You’re just the man to say, “ 1 won't ! ²²
Because in them you either don't
Believe, or else the contage lack
The truth through thick and thin to back,
And, rather than its heights aspire, ,
Will go on sticking in the mire.
At Rome you for the country sigh;

. Wheninthe countrytothesky
. Yon, flighty as the thistle's down,

Are always crying up the town.
If no one asks you out to dine,
Oh then the pot-auseris divine.
