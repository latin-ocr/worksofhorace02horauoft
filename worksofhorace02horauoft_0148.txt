1 34 Satira V. [uoox ι.

We turn our backs with much delight
On Fundi,* and its praetor, hight
Aufidius Luscus ; many a gibe
And jest upon that crack-brained scribe
We broke, and his pretentious ways,
His grand pretexta‚ all ablaze
With a broad purple band, flung o’er him,
And pans of charcoal borne before him.
Tired with the joumey of the day,
ln the Mamurrae's town’r we stay,
Where to Murena’s house we go,

But take our meals with Capito.

Here having rested for the night,
With inexpressible delight
We hail the dawn,-—for we that day
At Sinuessass on our way
With Plotius, Varius, Virgil too,

Have an appointed rendezvous;

Souls all, than whom the earth ne’er saw
More noble, more exempt from flaw,
Nor are there any on its round,

To whom I am more fond‘ly bound. '

Oh what embracings, and what mirth!
Nothing, no, nothing on this earth,

    
    
  
  

⁴* Having slept at Anxur, the travellers proceeded next day to Fundi.
the modern Fondi, sixteen miloe to the north-east. The main street of ’
the modern town is built on the Appian Way, and some portiom of the
old road have been preserved.

† Formiae, the modern Mola di Gaeta‚ about twelve mileu from
Fundi, has resumed its old name. and is now called Fet-mia. The ⁸
wealthy family of Mamurra had become owner-s of the property in and
about the town to such an extent that Horace calls it ‘⁸ the town of the
Mamurrae.” Murena, at whose house the travellers siem, was the brother ”
of Licymnia, the wife of Maeeenas.

:t Sinuessa was eighteen miles from Formiae. The site on which a
stood is now called Monte Dragone.
