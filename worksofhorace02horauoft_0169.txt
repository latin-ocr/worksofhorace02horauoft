Satire IX.

‘rhat’s loaded havia- than he likes;
But off anew my toi-ment strikes,
“lfwell 1 know myselssyou'll end
With making of me more a friend
‘nnn Viscus, ay, or Varius ; for
Of vet'soe who mn run off more,
otmnthem offat suchapaoe?
who dance with such distinguished grace?
And as for singing‚ zounds !'’ said he,
“ Hermogenes might envy me !''
Here was an opening to bienk in.
“ Have ym a mother, father, kin,

Towhom your life is precions?” ‘³ None ;—

l’ve closed the ἐγω of every one.”

0¹² happy they, 1 ἰών gronn-

Now 1 am lest, and Ι alone.

Quin-R, quick, despatch me where 1 stand Ξ

Now is the direful doom at hand

which erst the Sabine beldam old,

Shaking her magic um, foretold

Indays when 1 was yet a bey:—

“ Him shall no poisons fell destroy,

Nor hostile sword in shock of war,

Nor gont, nor colic, nor catarrh.

In fulness of the time his thread

Shall by a prate-apace be shred;

So let him, when he's twenty-one,

1'f he be wise, all babblers shun?
Now we were close to Vesta’s fane.

· '‘I'was hard on ten, and he, my bane,

was bound to answer to his hail,
Or lose his cause, is he should fail.

’ ‘⁶ Do, it you love me, step aside

One moment with me here? he cried.
