To bear me children! ” or, ‘⁴ These woodlands now
Cry out to be reclaimed and feel the plough !”

1f you've enough, how vain to wish sor more!
Nor house, nor lands. nor brass‚ nor golden store
Can of its fire the severed srame relieve,

Or make the care-fraught spirit cease to grieve.
Sound, mind and body both, should be his health
To true account who hopes to turn his wealth.
Fortune nor home not more the man can cheer‚
›Who lives a prey to covetise or sear,

Than may a picture's richest hues delight

Eyes that with dropping rheum are thick of sight,
Or warm sost lotions soothe a gout-racked ἰοῦς’
Or aching ears be charmed by twangling lute-
On minds unquiet joy has lost its power:

In a foul vessel everything turns sour.

Be moderate in your pleasures3 bought with pain.

Pleasure no pleasure is, but merely bane.

A mise1³s always poor. A bound assign

To what you want. then keep within the line.
The envious man grows hollow-eyed and thin,

As on his neighbour wealth comes rolling in:
Yes, envy racks its slaves with sharper stings
Than the worst tortures os Sicilian kings.†

Whoe’er curbs not his anger, but headlong

Flies to avenge by soree each fancied wrong,
Will rue what passion drives him to commit ε
Anger is but a short-lived fremy-fit.

* The cold—water cure had recently become famous in Rome, iu oon- 'f
sequence os its successful application by Antonius Musa in curing f
Augustus of the gout. Horace seems to imply that hot fomentations Β

aggravate rather than diminish the pains os gout.

† The allusion here may be to the buming buu of Phala-is. But the 54¹
kings os Sicily had a general reputation sor emelty. Some of their ξ

modern successors re·established that evil renown.
