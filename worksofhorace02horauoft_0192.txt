SATIRE 11.

WH AT the virtue consists in, and why it is great,
To live on a little, whatever your state

(’Tis not Ι who discourse, but Ofellus the hind,

Though no scholar, a sage of exceptional kind),

Corne, learn, friends! But not among tables bedight

With gold and with silver, and sparkling with light,

Where the eye with mad splendour is dazed, and the breast

Recoils from the truth, by false shows prepossessed,

Must the lesson be read, but this moment, and here,

Before you have dined‚ and away from good cheer.
Why so? you inquire. Ι will tell you. Who'd trust ,

Α judge, who had taken a bribe, to be just?

Gn, course down a hare, scamper league upon loegue

On a horse that’s unbroke, till you're spent with fatigue;

Or, if these our Roman gymnastics are too

Severe for such Greek-aping foplings as you,

Take a stiff bout at tennis, where zest in the sport

Makes the labour seem light, and the long hours seem suom , ·

Or if quoits should be more to your taste, smite away

At the thiu air with them the best part of a day3

And when the hard work has your squeamishness routed, ‚-

When you're parched up with thirst, and your hunger’s
undoubted‚ '

Then spum simple food, if you can, or plain wine,

Which no honeyed gums from Hymettus refine!
