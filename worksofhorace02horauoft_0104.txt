90 Notes to tlte Epodes.

Χαλεπὸν τὸ μὴ φιλῆσαι, natm.

‘⁶ Not to love is pain and ποθ,
And to love is pain also ;
But to love unloved again
Is a tensold sharper pain.
Linoege, high howe’er it mount,
Is in love of small account ;
Worth goes to the wall aud bmins,
Gold alone has all the gains.
Be the soul of him accursed,
On vile gold who doted. first!
Gold ’twixt brothers sets despite,
Makes the child the parents slight ;
Hence do bloody wars besan,
And, what diret is than all,
We poor lovers every one
Are by gold, alas! undone.”

Nemesis-not the groet Avenger, but the lady who was his pecu-
liar fate—taught Tibullus to his eost the truth of Anam-eon’s ereed.

Eheu, divitibus vidm gaudere puellas! he exclaims (Eleg. 11. 3).

“ Alas ! I see that waelthy churls .
Stand high in favour with the girls !'’

Propertius found the doctrine illustmted by his Cynthia :—

Cynthia non sequitur-fasces, non curat honora,
Semper amatorum ponderat illa sinus.

“ Title, honours, station, same,
These are not my Cynthia’s aim.
what to her are sighs οι· vetses?
She weighs lovers by their pulses?

Ovid is evermore ringing the changes on the same theme3 as, for
example,—

Ingenium quondam ficerat pretiosius auro, ’
At nunc barbaries grandis, habere nihil.

—Amores, B. 111. Eleg. viii·
