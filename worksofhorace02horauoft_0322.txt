308 To Vinius Asella. [noox 1.

The tale might get abroad, and wags proclaim
A special fitness in your family namefi‘·

O'er mountain, bog. and river bravely wend.
When, these all passed, you reach your journey's end,
Arrange it so, that in you do not bear
My lightsome load of literary ware
Tucked up beneath your arm, asrustics may
A lamb, or tipsy Pyrrhia† in the play
Her stolen wool-hall, or your village lout
Slippers and cap when he goes dining out.'.t -

Neither let everybody know how hard
You’ve toiled and sweated, carrying for a bard
Some things of his, that may, as you surmise,
F ix for an hour great Caesar’s ears and eyes.
Let no one stop you. Push right on, and take
Heed lest you trip, and my injunctions break.§

⁴* A pun on the name ‘'Asella''=d0nkey.

† Said by Cruquius to be a character in a comedy by Titinius. a
writer who lived before Terence.

ἶ The slippers were to put on when he reached the house of his host,
and had to lay aside his (probably ditty) walking shoes. The cap
(pileus) was a skull-cap of felt, which Hodge would bring with him to
wear on his way home at night.

ἓ Vinius Asella was probably one of Horaoe's country neighbours in
the Sabine country, whom he trusted to oerry his volume to Rome.
From the mention of ‘¹ mountain, bog, and river,·· Asella probably took
the short cut across the Sabine hills, and not the Via Valeria to Tibur,
and thence to Rome.
