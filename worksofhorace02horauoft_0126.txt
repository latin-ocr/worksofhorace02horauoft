1 1 2 Satire J. [noox 1. ·

Just as, when launched in full career,
On, onwards strains the charioteer
To outstrip the steeds that head the pace,
And scorns the laggards in the tace.
And thus it happens, that we can

So rarely light upon a man

Who may with perfect truth confess
His lise was one of happiness;

And, when its destined term is spent,
Can from its way retire content,

And like a well-replenished guest.

But now I've prosed enough; and lest
You think Ι have purloined the olio,
That crams Cn'spinus’s portfolios*

That pink of pedants most absurd,
1 will not add one other word.

⁴* Horace seems to have used Crispinus as Pope used Theobuld
and Cibber. Nothing is known of him beyond what Home tells ns.
Oblivion is the natural destiny os a man whose chief distinction was
that he 00qu turn out more verses on any given subject than othe-r men.
and always in ⁸⁸ one wmk. washy, everlasting· flood'' of seeble ssueney.
His name appaers again in the Third and Fourth Satira of this Book ' ’
and in the Sevemh Satire of the Second Book.
