Satira III.

Of wisdom, and, less sad of beart,
From the Fabrician bridge depart.
For, coming up, when at that place,—
As ruin stated me in the face,—
Covering my head, 1 was about

To take the river, he cried out :—

STERTINIUS.

The deed's ignoble. Pause! ’Twere best.

'Tis shame, false shame, impels you, lest
You be thought mad by people, who
Are certainly as mad as you.

What constitutes a man insane,

First ask with me; and, if that bane

Be yours alone, why, go your way,

I’ve not another word to say;

Hang, poison, drown yourself for me,
And die, like hero, gallantly.

In every man, who runs sans heed,
Where’er his headstrong passions lead,
Yea, every man who stumbles‚ through
Mete ignorance of what is true,
Chrysippus’ porch and all his sect
Downright insanity detect ς·-

Α rule, within its sweep that brings

Both common folks and mighty kings,
All save the wise man. Learn, then, how
All men are crazed as well as thou,
whom they proclaim insane! As in

A wood, when wayfarers begin

To lose their road, one goes this way,
Another that,—both quite astray,

Only by different tracks,—even ⁵0, ”
Crazy you are; but he, we know,
