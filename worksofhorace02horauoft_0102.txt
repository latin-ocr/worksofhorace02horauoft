“ Nor will your lord believe his tale 3⁷ of this
A trusty witch‚ by her divining art,
Assures me. Her have 1 beheld, 1 wis,
Making the stars from out their orbits start3 ,
‘The rushing rivers by her spells she turns,
The earth she piercae with her magic tonee,
Awakes the Manes from their lonely urus,
And from the yet warm pyres collects the bones;
Anon she summons forth, with eldritch shriek,
A phantom crowd, anon commands them back,
With milk besprent, the infernal shades to seek ;
From heaven cau she dispel the lowering rack,
Thicken at will the summer air with snows:
She only all Medea‘s herbs is famed
γ To hold in stote, and that great secret knows
Whereby dread Hecate’s savage hounds are tamed.”

only passed into another phase os existence? And does she now

Archilochus, and afterwards broke his promise. The ferocity of
the poet’s satire drove him to commit suicide. So, too, Bupalus,
a sculptor of Chios, who had caiioetured Hipponax, adopted the
same effectual means of escaping the sting os the satirist’s verses.
