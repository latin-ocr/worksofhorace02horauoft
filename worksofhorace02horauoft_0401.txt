 

The A rt of Poemy. 387

Τ he modest. srugal. sober-miuded few.

Who in the stage found ploesure ever new.

But when their lands by conquest waxed, and all

Too narmw grew the city's ancient wall;

When flowing cups might be quafl'ed down by noonx

And no one chide the saest as all too soon,—

'l'he rhythm and music also felt the change,

Took ampler licence and a wider range.

Yet what could audiencoe so mixed and crude

Know os good taste, when side by side the rude

Unlettered boor with well-bred solks would sit.

And loutish dullards jostled menos wit?

So the fise-player in his art found room

For pantomime and splendom· of costume, ·

And trailed long floating robes the stage around ς

So even the mmgre lyre new accents found.

And language, by impetuous passion stirred,

Broke into eloquence till then nubenti.

With saws oracular as Delphi's shrine,

To guide man's lise, his future to divine* ν
The bard who strove of yore in tragic strains .

To win the goat, poor guerdon of his pains,

Anon brought woodland satyrs in, and tried.

Is gay with grave might somehow be allied.

For only by the lure of things like these,

That by their novelty were sure to please,
