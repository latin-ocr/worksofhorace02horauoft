Index os F irst Lines.

All singers have this failing: asked to sing .

The banis of ancient comedy. when it was at its best .

Fresh from great Rome with all its din . .
Though Lydian none, Maecenas, may be found .
There's not an idler, Ι suppose

Erewhile Ι was a fig-tree stock .

It chanced that 1, the other day .

Lucilius’ verses, 'tis most true, I've said .

BOOK 11.

. Some people think, my satire hits .

What the virtue consists in, and why it is great .
You write so seldom, that Ι vow .

Whence and whither, Catius ?

My prayers with this 1 used to charge .-

EPISTLES.

BOOK 1.

Now that you've seen them all, Bullatius‚·—seen .
Dear Iccius. if you rightly use

'l'hese volumes, Vinius, (such my strict commands)
Grieve of my woodlands and my small domain .
Is winter at Velia mild or severe? .

As, dearest Quintius, you may wish to know .

Though your fine instinct, Scaeva, keeps you straight .
