EPODE 1.

TO MAECENAS.

F thou in thy Liburnians go
Amid the bulwarked galleys of the foe,
Resolved, my friend Maecenas, there
All Caesar's dangers as thine own to share,

What shall we do, whose life is gay

Whilst thou art here, but sad with thee away?
obedient to thy will, shall we

Seek ease, not sweet, unless 'tis shared by thee?
Or shall we with such spirit share

Thy toils, as men os gallant beart should bear?
Bear them we will; and Alpine peak

Scale by thy side, or Caucasus the bleak3
Or follow thee with dauntless breast

Into the sarthest ocean of the West.
And shouldst thou ask, how I could aid

Thy task3 unwarlike 1, and feebly made?
Near thee my sears, I answer, would

Be less, than did 1 absent o'er them brood;
As of her young, is they were left,

The bird more dreads by snakes to be berest,
Thau if she brooded on her nest,

Although she could not thus their doom arrest.
madly, in hopes your grace to gain,

I’ll share in this or any fresh campaign !
