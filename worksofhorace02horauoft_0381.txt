And in this way you purchase with your gold,
Little by little, land that erewhile sold

For a round rattli'ng figure, two or three
Thousands of pounds, or more as it may be.

For where's the difference, if what seeds you so
Were paid for yesterday or long ago?

The man who lives upon a fair estate,

At Veii or Aricia bought of late,

Sups on bought cabbage, though he knows it not,
And buys the sticks that boil his evening pot ;
Yet all his very own he calls the ground

To where the poplars mark his neighbour's bounds*
As if aught could be oum, and ours alone,

Ours, whom a turn of fortune may dethrone,
Which force or favour, money, death may take
From us, another o’er it lord to make.

As then we cannot keep, howe’er we crave,

And heir succeeds to heir, as wave to wave,
What boot broad lands, or teeming bams, domain
Calabrian stretched into Lucania’s plains,

If death, by gold not to be won, mows all

For his grim harvest, great alike with small?

⁴ Pope puts this proposition very effectively :—

‘¹ Haetheote himseffi and such large-aered men,
Lords of fat E'sham, or of Lincoln fen,
Buy every stick of wood that lends them haet,
Buy every pullet they afford to oet,
Yet these are wights. who sondly <all their own
Half that the devil o'erlooks from Linooln town.

‘ManP and for ever? ‘VVretch'1 what-womdst thou have?
Heir urges heir, like wave impelling wave,

Link towns to towns with avenues of oak,

Enclose whole downs with walls, 'tis all a ioke 1
Inexorable death shall level all,

And σεε, and stenes, and imm. and famer salv·
