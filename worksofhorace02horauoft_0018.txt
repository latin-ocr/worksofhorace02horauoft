Α lplcius. [EPODE 11.

Not, trust me, that more oxen may,
Yoked in my ploughshares‚ turn the yielding clay,
Nor that, to ’scape midsummer’s heat,
My herds may to Leucanian pastures sweet
From my Calabrian meadows change ;
Nor I erect upon the sunny range
Of Tusculum, by Circe's walls,
A gorgeous villa’s far-seen· marble halls Ξ
Enough and more thy bounty has
Bestowed on me ; I care not to amass
Wealth, either, like old Chremes in the play,
To hide in earth ; or fool, like spendthrift heir, away!

EPODE ΙΙ.

ALPHIUS.

APPY the man, in busy schemes unskilled,
Who, living simply, like our sires of old,
Tills the few acres which his father tilled,
Vexed by no thoughts of usury or gold 5*

⁴* '¹ Felix ille animi. divisque simillimus ipsis,
Quem non mendaci resplendens gloria suco
Sollicitat, nonfastosi mala gaudia luxus,
Sed tacitos sinit ire dies, et paupere cultu
Exigit amoenae tranquilla silentia vitae.''

—FRAcAs‘romus
¹¹ Happy the man, and to the gods akin,

WVhom dazzling glory with its treacherous glare,
And luxury's harmsul joys disquiet never ;

But who, in settled low humility,

Lets all his days glide noiselessly away,

And moves, with soul serene, amid the nooks
And silent byways os a blameless lise.''
