Yet Ι but the men. who give it you one day.
The next ean take it, ir they like. away.
Just as they oust from office in disgrace
⁸ The men whom late they lifted into place.
'⁸ Lay down the fasces! They are ours !’' they cry.
1 lay them down, and go with many 3 sigh.
But if these sels-same solks shall call me ‘¹ thies,'‘
swear that I’m ‘¹ profligate beyond belief?
Sti-angled my very father, shall 1 quail
Before their lies, or let my cheeks grow pale ?
No! None but fools or liars can be chax-med
By groundloes praise, by slanders be alarmed.
Who is the good man? “ He who holds in awe
statute and precedent. and right and law,
Whose lore judicia} settles mighty suits,
Whose witness or whose bail no man disputes.” ⁴*
Yet all his neighbours know, and all his kin,
This fair outside veils a black beart within.
Suppose the case, my slave to me should say,†
‘⁶ 1 never robbed you, sir, nor ran away.'’
“ You'll not be whipped then, so you have your meed.'‘
‘¹ I've done no murder-⁸· ‘⁸ Then you shall not seed
γ The crows upon the crossl· “ Oh, sir! 'tis true,
I'm honesty itself ; so saving too ! ’'
At this my simple Sabine sense recoils ε
“Ay, as the wolf that dreads the hunter's toils;
Ay, as the kestrel dreads the snare, pei-chance,
Or gumards eye well-plenished hooks askanee.
Sin for mere virtue's sake all good men hate.
’Tis sear of punishment that keeps you straight.

⁸ Theansvterissupposed to be given. as the mass of peoplewould
give it. who indge only by what they see on the surfaoe.
