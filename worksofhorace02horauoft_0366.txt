So these uncouth Saturnian strains declined,

And slashing force gave place to wit refined.

But traces of the old rough boorish vein

Remained for many a day, and still remain3

For it was late before the Romans sought

For treasure in the mines of Grecian thought.

The Punic wars were o’er, and Rome at ease,

Ere we began to ask what Sophocles,

Thespis and AEschylus to us might teach.

Then rose the wish to clothe in Roman speech

What by these mighty masters had been told,

And Roman genius, by its nature bold

And high-aspiring, caught the tragic tone.

Impressed it with a cadence os its own,

And might have shone, but that it values not,

Nay, holds in very scorn, the art to blot*
People are wont to fancy, that because

Her characters from common lise she draws‚

’Tis easy to write comedy; but they

Forget, the truth lies all the other way;

Because the comic writer, if he halts,

Can count on no indulgence for his saults.

Easy? Why, look at Plautus! What poor stuff

His love-siek lover is, his father gruffi

Gruff and close-fisted, his sly sneaking pimp !

Dossennus’ hungry parasites, how limp

And colourless they are Ξ Mark how he rocks

About the stage with loose ungirded socks Ξ

⁴* In his Imitation of this Epistle, Pope says—

“ Even copious Dryden wanted, or sorgot,
The last and greatest art, the art to blot?

“ What not to say '' is in composition the touchstone of a man's
genius, as “What not to do ’' is in action the supreme test of his capac-
ity and tact. From what he says of Lucilius and others, it is evident
that Horace set the highest value on this habit of mind. ·
