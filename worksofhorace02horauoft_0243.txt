Satire VI.

Arellins’ wealth, son-getting how
Muchmoe it costs him, “Lookyou now,
Once on a time* he will begin,

“A country mouse received within

His rugged cave a city brother,

As one old comrade would another.

‘A frugal mouse upon the whole,

But loved his friend, and had a sonl,’
And could be fiee and open-handed,
When hospitality demanded.

In brief, he did not spate his hoard

Of corn and pease, long coyly stored;
Raisins he brought, and seraps, to boot,
Half-gnawed, of bacon, which he put
With his 'own mouth before his guest,
In hopes, by offering his best

In such variety, he might

Persuadehim to an appetite.

But still the cit, with languid eye,

Just picked a bit, then put it by;

Which with dismay the rustic saw,

As, stretched upon some stubbly straw,
He munched at bran and common grsts,
Not venturing on the dainty bits.

At length the town mouse ; ‘Whatss says he,
‘ My good friend, can the pleasure be,
Of grubbing here, on the backbone

Of a great mg with trees'o'ergrown?
Who'd not to these wild woods prefer
The city, with its crowds and stit?
Tben come with me to town 3 you'll ne’er
Regret the honr that took you there.

All earthly things draw mortal breul„
Nor great nor little can from death ’
