144 S atire VI. [Boon 1.

No dread had he, that men might taunt or jeer‚

Should Ι, some future day, asauctioneer,

Or, like himself, as tax-collector seek

With petty vails my humble means to eke.

Nor should Ι then have murmured. Now Ι know,

More earnest thanks, and lostier praise 1 owe.

Reason must fail me, ere I cease to own

With pride, that 1 have such a father known!
Nor shall Ι stoop my birth to vindicate,

By charging, like the herd, the wrong on F ate,

That Ι was not of noble lineage sprung:

Far other creed inspires my heart and tongue.

For now should Nature bid all living men

Retrace their γεω, and live them o'er again,

Each culling, as his inclination bent,

His parents for himself, with mine content,

I would not choose whom men endow as great

With the insignia and the seats of state;

And, though Ι seemed insane to vulgar eyes,

Thou wouldst perchance esteem me truly wise,

In thus refusing to assume the care

Of irksome state I was unused to bear. ι
For then a larger income must be made,

Men's favour com-ted, and their whims obeyed,

Nor could I then indulge a lonely mood,

Away from town, in country solitude,

For the false retinue of pseudo-friends,

That all my movements servilely attends.

More slaves must then be fed, more horses too,

And chariots bought. Now 1 have nought to do, ’

Would I as far as even Tarentum* ride,

But mount my bobtailed mule, my wallets tied

⁴* Tarentum (the modern Taranto) is used here to express a remote ”
part os Italy. Horace rejoiees in a sreedom denied to men in high
