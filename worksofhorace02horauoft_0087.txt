*⁸ seems to resemble port, according to the opinions of many oon-
χ nei-ms. Other vinee required a longer time to mellow. Thus
¹ the Alban wine was not mature under twenty years. Horace (odes,
” ιν. 12), however, seems to have thought itin high mnditiou in nine.

‘nne wine of Son-rento required to be kept for twenty-five years.

. These general mles must, of course, have been liable to many ex-
* cepticos, according to the quality os the vintage of particular years,
the way the wine had been made or kept, and other circumstances.
; Thus Cicero, aster dining with Damasippus, eulogises some Faler-

nian, fmy years old, as having borne its age well—bene aetatemsert.

χ Like ourselves, the Romans occasionally spoiled their wines by
fl keeping them too long. Cicero (Brut. 83), speaking of the
⁸ speeches of Thucydides, compares them to very old Falernian,
³ aud says the style had better be avoided, “tanquam Amicianam

udam? like wine of the consulship of Amicius3 and he adds,

Ἴ “atqumnaeaesmoptinaae, credo, sed nimia vanatasnechabeteam

quant querimus suavitatem, nec est jam sane tolerabilis.”
Hmoe (Satires 11. viii. 15) speaks of the Chian wine introduced
nt the dinner of Nasidienus, which had no doubt been bought at a

η . high price, as having lo& its body, “maris expers.”

-, It is oontended that the Neaera of this Ode is the Neaera of the
ξ’ 15th Epode„ with whom Horace there remonstrates for her infidelity,
and that the concluding lines indicate thatin the days of Plancus’s

· ouisulate (ac, 42), when Horace was twenty-four, he would have

knocked down that lady's porter, if he had given him a surly answer.

1 'nnt he would “in his hot youth '' have handled roughly the con-
g. cierge of that N eaera, or of any other lady of her profession, is most
ἐ prohable. But the Noeera os the 15th Epode was by this time seven-

teen years older at least 3 and there was no such dearth of younger
beauties of her class as to eompel us to conclude that she and she

³. only could be the Neaera here referred to.
