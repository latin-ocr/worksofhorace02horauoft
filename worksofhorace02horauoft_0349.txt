READ the meaning of that wistsul look
Towards Janus and Vertumnus, Ο my book 2*
Upon the Sosii's shelves you long to stand,
Rubbed smooth with pumice by their skilsul hand.
You chase at lock and modest scal: you groan,
That you should only to a few be shown,
And sigh by all the public to be read,
You in far other notions trained and bred.
Well, go your way, whereso you please and when,
But, once sent forth. you come not back again.
⁴⁶ Fool that 1 was 1 why did Ι change my lot?”
You'll cry, when wounded in some tendet spot,
¹ And, out of sashion and of favour grown,
⁶, You’re crumpled up, and into corners thrown.
Unless my ill-divining spirit be
Warped by chagrin at your perversity‚
Thus with sure presage I forecast your doom ;
You will be liked by Rome, while in your bloom,
But soon as e’er the thumbing and the soil
of vulgar hands shall your first freshnoes spoil,

q ⁴* The shop of the Sosii. the great booksellers of Rome. was in the
J *vicinity of the temples ofJanus and Vertumnus. The street was there·
