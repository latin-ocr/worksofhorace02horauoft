154 Satire IX. [Boox 1.

To put this incubus to rout !''
As he went chattering on about
Whatever he descriae or meets,
The orowds, the beauty of the streete»,
The city's growth, its splendonr, sige.
“ You’re dying to be ofl'‚'’ he cries;
For all the while I'd been struck dumb.
“ I’ve noticed it some time. But come,
Let’s clearly understand each other;
It's no use making au this pother.
My mind's made up to stick by you;
So where you go, there 1 go too.''
“ Don't put yourself‚” 1 auswered, “ pray,
So very sar out of your way.
I'm on the road to see a friend,
Whom you don’t know, that’s near his end,
Away beyond the Tiber far,
Close by where Caesar’s gardens are.” ⁴¹·
‘⁵ I've nothing in the world to do,
And what’s a paltry mile or two?
1 like it, so 1⁷11 follow you !'’
Down dropped my ears on haring this,
Just like a vicious jackass’s

¹* These were gardens on the right bank of the Tiber, near the Pons
Sublicius—-the much-revered bridge. which had been kept by “stout
Horatius Cocles.'’ They were bequoethed byJulius Caesarto the Roman
people. Shakespeare makes Antony in his speech over Caesar's body
referto this gift (Julius Caeear. Act iii. Sc. 2) :-

¹¹ Moreover, he bath lest you all his walks,
His private arbom-s and new—planted erchards.
On this side Tiber ι he hath left them you*
And to your heirs sor ever ; common pleasures.
To wall: abroad and recreate yourselvae.—-
Here was a Caesar 1 When comes such another·

They were a raesonably long walk distant from the Sacra Via.
