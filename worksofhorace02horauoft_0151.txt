mox 1.] Satire V. 1 37

Eseaped most narrowly fmm burning ;
For while he was intent on turning
Some starveling thrushes on the ceals,
Out from the crazy brazier rolls
A blazing brand, which caught and spread
To roos and raster overhead.
sse hungry guests„ oh how they ran!
And frightened servants, to a man,
The supper from the flames to snatch‚
And then to quench the blazing thatch.
Apulia here begins to show
The hius 1 knew well long a'gos*
Swept by Atabulus’ sultry blast‚
And over which we ne’er had passed,
But that within a farmhouse near
Trivicus Ἰ- we found hearty cheer,
Wen mixed with tearsul smoke, 'tis true,
From fagots thick with leaves, that strew
The barth, and sputter‚ spit‚ and steam.
Past midnight here, oh dolt supreme!
-1 waited for a lying jade,
Till sleep at length its finger laid
On me still panting with desire,
And then my fancy, all on fire,
With visions not the chastest teems‚
And I possess her in my dreams.
In chaises hence we travel post
Some four-and·twenty miles at most,
At a small hamlet halting‚ which
Into my verse declines to hitch‚'.t
³ These were his native bins.
