Then, too, the yearS, they rob us», as they run,
Of au things we delight in, one by one ;
Sport, love, feast, frolic they have wrenched away,
And verse will follow at no distant day.
Write! Ay, but what? For, as you know, one finds
Men’s tastes in verse as various as their minds.
Yon like the Ode ; in Epodes some delight,
In Satire others barbed with words that bite.
1 have three guests to dine. Alas sor me,
Their tastes about no single dish agree Ξ
What shall 1 give? What not? You oen’t abide
Ήιε very thing for which another cried‚
And what 1 give as a bonne bouche to you
Js sour and odious to the other twa*
Write verse in Rome, too? How could 1, in fact,
Amidst so much to worry and distract?
“ Bail me 1 ’² writes one. ‘⁴ Cut business for the day,”
Another, “and 1⁷11 read you my new play Ξ ”
Tben on the Quirinal is one sick friend,
One on Mount Avendne, quite at the end,†
And each of these expects a call from me—
Nice manageable distances‚ you see.
“ But then the streets are clear3 with nought‚'' you say,
‘⁴ To hinder one from musing by the way! ²²
Why, here a builder in a sume you meet,
With mules and porters cramming all the street.
Anon a crane, whirling a stone in air
Or mighty beam, obstructs the thoroughfare.
Then there’s a block of dismal funeral trains
Jammed up and struggling with huge cumbrous wains3 ⁴
Anon a mad dog rushes foaming by,
Anon a pig, all reeking from the sty.

⁴* Happily paraphrased by Pope in the lines—
'' Hard task! to hit the palate os such gum,
When Oldfield loves what Dartineus detests.''
'† Τὴε opposite extremes of Rome.
