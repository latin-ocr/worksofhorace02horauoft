354 Τ o Α agustus. [Boon 11.

Cars, chariots, ships, in thronged succession pass,

And captured ivory towers with captive brass.''‘·
Oh how, Democritus, ’twould move thy mirth,

Had fate still left thee here upon the earth.

To see the mob all eyeS, all straining hard,

Because a brute, half camel and half pard,

Or a white elephant, was on the stage!

More than these shows the people would engage

Your eye, as furnishing for thought more food

Than any play or any actor could.

But sor the author, he, poor wretch! you'd say,

Spoke to a deas ass that too well could bray ;

For where is mortal voice the din could quench,

Rings through our theatres from bench to bench?

You'd think you heard the Gargan forest roar,

Or the sea breaking on the Tuscan shore,

Such ιε the peal, that hails the jewels rare,

The foreign vestments s in these the player

All richly dight, but u garded, stands,

Amid the clapping of ῖῷ thousand hands.

“But has he spoken. >³² '²⁴31‘ Not one word. '” “Explain
This rapture then. Ρ· “tHis robe! Its gorgeous purple
grain. '”

And yet in case it may be thought that 1
Damn with saint praise an art 1 sear to try,
But other men have practised with success,
Him foremost among poets I confess,

Who with fictitious sorrows wrings my breast.
Rouses my passions, calms them into rest.
With visionary fears my soul can thrill,

And sweep me off, as if by magic skill,

To Thebes, to Athens—anywhere he will.

⁴* Can it be said that our English audiences are not open to the
same reproach? Nor ours only. Throughout the ¹continent of Europe
the same delight in soenic splendour has wellnigh swaniped the drama·
