EPISTLE ΙΙ.

EAR, Florus‚* noble N ero's friend, a tale.
A dealer has a smart young slave for sale,

At Tibur born, we’ll say, or Gabii‚†
And thus addresses you, in hopes you'll buy.
“ He’s handsome, free from blemish, hale all round,
And you shall have him sor just sixty pound.
He’s sharp,—a nod's enough—no need to speak!
And has some little smattering of Greek. ,
Art? Why, there's none he would not leam with ease·‚
Soft plastic clay to mould to what you please.
He has a voice, too, not been trained but fine,
You'd like his singing as you sit at wine.
I won't say more, for puffing of one’s war-es
We know’s a thing that buyers often scates.

* This Epistle is addressed to the same person as the third of the
First Book. It was obviously written some years afterwards. when
Florus was again absent from Rome in the suite of ’Rhenus Claudius
Nero,—most probably on the expedition against the Dalmatians and
Pannonians. which began A.U.c. 743. and kept Tiberius absent from
Rome sor four years, with the exception of a short interval. when he
brought back the remains os his brother Drusus. Of all the Epistlefl
none has more charm in matter and in treatment. ne light it throws
upon the writer’s biography is most valuable. Is sheer necessity made
him a poet, as he says. the conscientiousness of the true artist and
studious critic made him slow to write, and unsparing in his efforts to
give the highest polish to his work, and that semblanoe of ease which
is the perfection of art. In the retioence and sels-restraint of genius he
presents a pattern which prolific verse-makers would do well to emulate.

† That is, ‘¹ anywhere you please.''
