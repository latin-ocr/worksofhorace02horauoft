380 lee A rt of Poetry.

If in their griefs they'd have us take a part,
And send them home to the spectator's heartfi‘

Fine things won’t make a drama ε it must thrill
The hearers' souls, and sway them at its will.†
A face all smiles makes other faces smile,

A sace all tears will tears from others wile.
Unless, then, in your voice a sob I hear,

Yon will not wring from me a single tear;
But let me hear it, and each woe of thine,

O Telephus and Peleus, will be minc ἔ

But if your words and woes no measure keep,
Ι either laugh outright or go to sleep.

Sad saws befit sad looks, as words of fire
And menace suit a face that’s flushed with ire.
Light quips match with a look of jovial cheer‚
And „solemn phrases with a brow austere.

For nature forms us so, that from'within

The moods that fortune works in us begin.

She prompts to anger, or impels to mirth,·

Or drags us down, with sorrow bowed, to earth;
Then, later on, she in the tongue will find
Expression for whate'er has moved the mind. :t

⁴* Telephus, King of Mysia, son os Hercules, having been wounded
by Achilles, was told that he could be cured only by the touch of the
steel which wounded him. So he left his home (exsul), and in the guise
of a beggar (pauper) sought Achilles, who cured him in the way indi-
cated. Peleus, the son of AEacus, was twice exiled. -once from his native
AEgina, for abetting the murder os his brother Phocus; and again, from
Thessaly, sor having involuntarily killed Euryteon, King of Phthia, who
had received him at his court, and given him his daughter in marriage.
Both subjeets seem to have been treated by Euripides. The truth of the
maxim in the text, that the language of the deepest grief is simple. often
homely, might be demonstrated by a host of passages from Shakespeme.

† Non satis est pulchra esse poemata ,· dulcia sunto. A poetioel
drama must appeal not to the imagination only, but also to the beart.
This seems to be the meaning of these words. over which rivers of eriti-
cal ink have been spilt.

sonum etgestum.'’-Cicero, de Orat„ 111. 57.
