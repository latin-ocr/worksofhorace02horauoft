 

mnu ι] To Augustus. ⁴ 349

Doctors prescribe. who understand the rules,

And only workmen handle workmen's mols:

But literate and illiterate, those who can.

And those who cant, write verses to a mans*
And yet this craze, this little twist of hrain,

Brings some not trifling virtues in its train.

Rarely is avarice in a poet known:

He loves his lines, and cares sor them alone.

Loss may succeed to loss, slaves run away,

His very house take fire, he still is gay.

He broods no deep-laid schemes, this simple hard,

To cheat a partner. or an infant ward.

He lives on pulse and second bread. and though

In a campaign he'd make a sorry show.

Yet is he of some service to the state,

If little things may minister to great.

The hard it is, whose well-conned verses teach

Our childhood's lisping tongue the arts of speech:

He weans the ears os boyhood from the twang

Os vulgar accents, and from ribaId slang;

Anon his precepts mould the heart and mind.

And make them gentle, genereus, and kind;

*The “ Soecla’ inconmoda, pessimi poetoe,'' denounced by Catunus,
hadwaxed in numbers and in strength since his days. The spread of
educationi, and the increase in the numbers os men in oesy circumstan-
ces, with no particular work to do in life. produced its natural results.
Whatothersdid well and with applause. people with a literasy taste
thought they might also do with no less success. Only the truly cul-
tivatedknew that in literature. as in art, good work is the outcome of
thedevotion os a life, with aspecialgist at its backtojustifythe devo·
tion. Hence the flood οἱ commonplace in ode. in elegy. in epic. and in
drama, with which society in Rome was apparently deluged in the
time of Augustus. Horace, as one of the popular poets of the day. of
course came in for a liberal share os that persecution to which pseudo-
poets are prone to subject successful men ot* genius. Although he
striks hard at them at times. he has yet a kindly feeling to these un-
inspired votas-iffi of the Muse, and finds in some of them the simple
virtus, in which their modern succaesors are not always deficient.
