And hold all verse in scorn. but what is both
Ol' antiquated date and foreign growth3
So wedded to the past. that even the code
Which to the Ten wise Men its sanction owed‚*-
The treaties with the Gabii made. and more
Unbending Sabines, by our kings of yore.†—
The Pontiffs’ Books,—the tomes of hoary eld,
Wherein our whole soothsaying lore is held, :t
To them are poems of the first account.
Caught from the Muses' lips on Alba's Mount.

But if because, as it must be eonsessed,
Of Grecian works the oldest are the best,
The axiom holds with Roman writers too.
Best give up talking without more ado 3
At once plead white is black, and black is white,
Say that we've reached perfection's topmost height,
In painting, music. too, the Greeks excel.
And even in wrestling bear away the bell.

Π poen-y, like wine, improve by age.
What term of years stamps value on the page?

⁴* The allusion here is to the Twelve Tables, in which the fundamental
principles os the Roman law were embodied. Cicero speaks of their
literury style with more respect than Horace, admiring not only the
incisive force of the substance but the grace of the language-“Ad-
nim nec rerunt solun, scd verborum etiam elegantiam '¹ (de Rep„
iv. 8).

† Horace is supposed to refer to the treaty by which Sextus Tar-
quinitas obtained possession os Gabii sorbis father Tarquinius Superbus,
and to that between Romulus and Tatim. which united the Romans
aud Sabina as one people.

:t These had grown to an enormous bulk by the time Augustus as-
sumed the office os Pontifex Maximus. They were. as the text implies,
prophetioin their character. and in a semi-metrical sonu. Niebuhr,
ou thestrength of the very few fragments which are still extant. says
they were extremely poetioel, and declines to adopt Horace as a judge
in the matter, Poetieal or not, Augustus made short work with them;
sor, according to Suetonius. he burned them all. with the exception of
those known as the Sibylline Books. which were in Greek.
