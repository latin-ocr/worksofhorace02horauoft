Satira VIII. [noox 1.

On Hecate one, Tisiphone ,

The other calls 3 and you might see
Serpents and hell-hounds thread the dark,
Whilst, these vile orgies not to mark,
The moon, all bloody·red of hue,

Behind the massive tombs withdrew.

Why should I more? Why teil how each
Pale ghost with wild and wosul screech
To gibbering Sagana answer makes ;
How grizzled wolves and mottled snakes
Slunk to their holes 3 and how the fite,
Fed by the wax, flamed high and higher3
Or what my vengeance for the woe

1 had been doomed to undergo

By these two Furies, with their shrieks
Their spells, and other ghastly freaks?

Back to the city scampered they:
Canidia's teeth dropped by the way,

And Sagana's high wig; and you

With laughter long and loud might view
Their herbs, and charmed adders, wound
In mystic coils, bestrew the ground.
