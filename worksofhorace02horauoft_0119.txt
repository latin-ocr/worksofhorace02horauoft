BOOK 1.

SATIRE 1.

ELL me, Maecenas, if you can,

How comes it, {hat no mortal man
Is with his lot in lise content,
Whether' he owae it to the bent

Of his free choice, or fortune‘s whim ἓ

And why is there such cham sor him

In the pursuit. his neighbour plies?

“ Ο happy, happy merchants θ’ exies

The soldier crippled with the hanes

Of age, and many hard mmpaigns.

“ A soldier's is thevlife for me!”

The merchant shouts, whilst on the sea

His angosies are tossing far ;

“ For, mark ye, comes the tug of war,

Host grapples host, and in a breath

”sis glorious victory or death !”

The lawyer deems the sarmer blest,

When roused at cock-crow from his rest

By clients—those prodigious bores—

Thundering rlveille' on his doors ς

Whilst he, by business dragged to town

From {army field and breezy down,

Vows happiness is only theim,

Who dwell in crowded streets and squares.
