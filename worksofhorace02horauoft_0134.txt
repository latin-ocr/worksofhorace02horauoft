“ 120 Satira III. [mox 1.

Wh0, if they can't by the appointed day,
By hook or crook, get wherewithal to pay
His principal or interest, must sit

In double bondage to his suit and wit,
Hear him recite his histories long-drawn,
Nor dare the solace of one truthful yawn.

Or if my friend, somewhat o'erflushed with wine,
Upon my couch his dirty soles recline,

Or from the table with his elbow throw
Some dish Evander* used, long, long ago,
Is he sor this, or yet because he may,

By hunger overcome, have swept away

The chicken from the dish before me placed,
In my regards to sink, and be disgraced?
Let this be so, and then what can 1 do,
Should he turn thies, or to his oath untrue,
Or prate of things committed to his trust?
Who hold as equal all offences must

Be sorely puzzled, when they come to deal
With what the facts of real lise reveal.

Their creed is contrary to common-sense,
To usage, nay, to that experience

Of man’s true needs, which may be said to be
Of justice mother, and of equity.

When human beings from primeval clay
Crawled forth at first, and struggled into day,
Dumb squalid brutes, for dens and amm-mast
They fought with nails and fists, then clubs, at last
With such rude armS, as they by slow degrees
Were driven to frame by their necessities;

ᾗ Not Evander the engraver and statuary, as contenderi by the
scholiam, but Evander the king and ally of AEneas. The collector of
rare china, who in the circumstances here supposed will bear no grudge
against the destroyer of the gem of his collection, must be magnanimous
indeed. “
