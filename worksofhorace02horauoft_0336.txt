But list the man into a ltigher sphere,

Who in a blanket wrapped his lore austere,

And ’twill surprise me greatly, if he bear

His change os life with a becoming air.

Though well on him a robe of purple sit,

The one won't keep the house for want of it,

But, dressed no matter how, the streets will pace,

And draw admiring eyes in either case.

The other dreads a fine-spun cloak as much

As mad dog’s bite, or adder's deadly touch :

‘⁴ Restore his blanket, or he'll die of cold ;”

Well, give it back, and let the fool grow old !
To steer the vessel of the State, to show

To grateful citizens a captive foe,

Is to approach the throne of Jove, and see

Glearns of that heaven where the Immortals be.

place at table. “No doubt,” said Aristippus, “you meant to do
honour to the places· The Seventh Epistle of this Book shows that
Horace had in him much of the spirit of Aristippus. In a letter ω M.
Thieriot in 1756, Voltaire writes in a vein akin to that of Horace: ''Je
suis redevenu Sybarite, et je me suis fait un sejoux delicieux3 mais je
vivrais aussi aisement comme Diogene que comme Aristippe. Je pre-

chaumiere, je serais tres-bien dans la chaumiere. ee n'oet que pour 1oe
autres que je vis en opulence ; ainsi J’e defie la fortune, et je jonis d'un
etat tres-doux et tres-libre que Je ne dois qu'a moi. '⁶
