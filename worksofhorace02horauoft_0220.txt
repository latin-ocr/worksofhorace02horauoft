satire III. ⁷ [ωσι 11.

When, armed, he shows a soul of flame,

And gast, much bigger than his frame.

That he's ridiculous you see,

But are you much less so than he?

Whate’er Maecenas does, you try3

But is it meet, that you should vie

With one so all unlike‚ so great,

Beyond what you can emulate?

A bullock trod to death one day

A brood of frogs,-— their dam away.

One froang, who escaped the smother,

Telling the story to his mother,

How a huge beast came up-a crash—

Then kith and kin all squeezed to smash!

“How big was it? ’' she asked, and blew

Herself out. “ Big as this, think you?'’

“ Oh, twice as big! ” ‘⁴ As this, then ?'’ So

Continuing to puff and blow‚

“ Blow, till you burst, ma'am ! ” frogling eries,
You’ll ne'er be match for him in size.”

The sable, old, but ever new,

Conies pretty closely home to you.

Add now your poems (oil to flame);

If any versemonger can claim

To be considered sane, why then,

You are as sane as other men.

Your srightful fits of tage-of these

1 will not speak. ⁴

nomen.
Have done, nom—plase!

DAMASIPPUS.
Your style of living, much beyond
Your means—-
