Amassing more, when you have much to spate,
But rather revel, like a happy boy,
In his brief holiday’s too short-lived joy.
If only poverty keep from my door,
Unlovely poverty‚ 1 ask no more 3
The ship 1 sail in may be large or small,

Yet neither have we always adverse gales.
In strength, in worth, in influence, powers os mind,
In rank and fortune, though 1 come behind
Theveryforemost, manyyet there be
That in their turn come lagging after me.
You’renot amiser! Good! Can it be said,
Allothervioe withthatofgreedhasfled?
'nm rage, the sear of death, the fierce unrest
Οἱ vain ambition trouble not your breast?
That you can laugh at dreams, hags‚ magic sleights‚
Thessalian spells, and ghosts that walk o’ nights?
Do you the sailings of your friends forgive ?
Thank heaven for each new birthday that you live?
And, as old age comes stealing on, do you
Grow better, gentler, more sorbearing too ἓ
What boots it from the breast one thorn to tear,
That is but one of many lurking there?
If how to live as best befits a man
You <lo not know, make way for those who can.
You’ve had as much as should your beart content
Of sport, and meat, and drink3 'tis time you went,
Lost youth, that fitlier plays the fool than age,
Should thrust the maudlin toper off the stage. ⁸
