EPODE XV.
'ro NAEERA.

’ WAS night l-let me recall to thee that night!
The silver moon, in the unclouded sky,
Amid the lesser stars was shining bright,
When in the words I did adjure thee by,
Thou with thy clinging arms, more tightly knit
Around me than the ivy clasps the oak,

Didst breathe a vow——mock the great gods with it—
A vow which, false one, thou hast foully broke ;
That while the ravened wolf should hunt the flocks,

The shipman’s foe, Orion, vex the sea,
And Zephyrs list the unshom Apollo’s locks,
So long wouldst thou be fond, be true to me l

Yet shall thy heart, Naeera, bleed for this,
For if in Flaecus aught of man remain,
Give thou another joys that once were his,
Some other maid more true shall soothe his pain3
Nor think again to lure him to thy bean l 7
The pang once felt, his love is past recall ;
And thou, more savoured youth, whoe'er thou art,
Who revell’st now in triumph o'er his fall,
Though'thou be rich in land and golden store,

In lore a sage, with shape framed to beguile,
Thy heart shall ache when, this brief fancy o'er,
She seeks a new love, and I calmly smile.
