And give the Muses' churlish humours up,
That you on game brought down by each may sup.
’Tis a true Roman sport. It nerves the frame,
Gives lise a zest, and gets you a good name.
For you especially such sport is meet,—
You, strong as wild-boar, and as greyhound fleet.
Besides, all manly weapons wh'o can wield
With more distInguished grace? In Mars's F ield
What ringing cheers your prowess ost have scaled ?
XVhen a mere stripling, too, you served in Spain,
Through all the hardships of a fierce campaign,
Under that general, who from Parthia's shrines
Brought back our standards to the Roman lines,
And now makes alien lands, if such there be,
To Rome's resistless armies bend the knee.
Again, should you still think of saying nay,
To cut the shadow of excuse away,
T hink of the mock fights, reflex not unmeet
Of that great fray, down at your father's seat.
With boats for galIeys, slaves for fighting men,
The fight at Actium is fought o’er again.
The lake serves sor the Adriatic Sea ;
You lead ; your brother heads the enemy,
And on you fight, till winged Victory lays
Upon your brow or his the wreath of bays.

—To show some zeal for your friend’s tastes insures
His very warmest sympathy for yours.

But with my words of warning to proceed,
If haply you a word of warning need ἔ
Ere of a man you tell a thing, think well
To whom you tell it, also what you tell.
The man that pesters you with questions shun—
Tattlers are dangerous, and he is one. “
lVide-gaping ears no secrets can retain,
And words once spoken you woo back in vain.
