Ι 74 Satire I. [soox 11.1.

Sent thither, says tradition eld,

What time the Samnites were expelled, . .

To keep back foes from Roman ground,

tho through thesewilds might else have found

An entrance, or, belike‚ to stand

Betwixt the Apulian people and.

Lucania’s headstrong sons, and mar

Their love of breaking into war.

But never shall this pen contrive

Assault on any man alive.

Like a good sword within its sheath,

'Twill prove that I can show my teeth‚

But draw it why should Ι, 50 long

As thieves don’t seek to do me wrong?

erant, Jove, great sire and king, it may

Rust in its scabbard day by day,

Nor any one fall foul of me,

Who fain at peace with all would be!

But he, that shall my temper try—

'Twere best to touch me not, say 1—

Shall rue it, and through all the town

My verse shall damn him with renem*
Smite Cervius, and his indignation

Vows suits at law for defamation;

Canidia with her poisons strikes.

The people down whom she dislikes.

And woe betide you, if your judge

Be Turius, and he bear you grudge!

Learn this with me, ’tis nature’s law,

Through what we're strongest in to awe

φ · tran-513 .-
Ηὲρριιζ Ἦὴοεὲξῗέζιιξεοὲίεοωε unlucky time
Slides into verse, and hitchae in a rhyme ;
sacred to ridicule his whole life long,
And the sad bun-den of a men-y song.’'
