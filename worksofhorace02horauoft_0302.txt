EPISTLE VI Ι.
το MAECENAS.

IVE days or so, Ι said. Ι should be gouer*
Yet August's past, and still 1 linger on.

Tis true I’ve broke my promise. But if you
Would have me well, as 1 am sure you do.
Grant me the same indulgence, which, were 1
Laid up with illness, you would not deny.
Although I claim it only for the sear
Of being ill, this deadly time of year,
When autumn's clammy heat and early fruits
Deck undertakers out, and inky mutes: ’
When young mammas, and fathers to a man,
With terrors for their sons and heirs are wan:
When stifling anteroom, or court, distils
Fevers wholesale, and breaks the seals of wills.†
Should winter swathe the Alban fields in snow. ‚
Down to the sea your poet means to go,

ἕ Horace says “quinque diebus,·’ but this was only a conventional
expression sor *any brief period, as we should say ¹³2. week or so.'' ¹
Horace uses it in this sense in the Satira 111. Book 1. line 16, '⁸ Quinque ⁷ ’
dicbus nil crat in loculis”—

⁸¹ Give him ten thousand pounds, this frugal soul,
And in a week he would have spent the whole.”

† ΤΙιε evil character of Rome in the autumnal months stin adhaec to ⁷
it. 'rhose who can leave it follow Horace's example. “Breaks the ξ
sals of wills'' is a happy periphrase sor causing numerous deutha, , ’
when. of course, the wills of those who had anything to leave had their
saels broken. ’
