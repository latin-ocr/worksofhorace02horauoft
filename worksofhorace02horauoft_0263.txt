wm never smm yom- wretched state
Of mean alm-ms emancipate ?
laet me add one thing more, which may
As much as any other weigh.
Though ench of us slaves, who obeys
Another slave, be, in your phrase,
An underling‚ can you ignore
The fact, that he's nor less nor more
Thau just his fellow-slave? Go to!
How then do 1, sir, stand to you?
You, over me who dominecr,
Are slave to other men, a mere
Automatom who. at their will
Is set in motion, or stands still.

who, then, isfree? ΤΙιε ννίεοιιιωι, who
Can at all times himself subdue,—
Whom neither want, nor death, nor chains
Appah-who manfully restrains
His appetite& nor cares to win
Titles or honours, and, within
Himself sels-centred and complete,
Life’s chance and change can frankly meet—
Yea, frent the heaviest blows of fate
With courage constant and sedate.
To which can you—in very shame-
of ail these qualities lay claim?
Some wench, all smiles and phrases bland,
Osa cool thousand* makes demand,
Pouts, teazes, mys, cajoles, implores ;
Υοιι won’t !—She kicks you out os (lours,
And with cold water slops you. Then,
When she entreats you back again—
