And so what ministers to use unites

With what is beautiful in all he writes. ¹

These are the works on which the Sosii thrives*

That cross the seas, to times remote survive.
Yet on sorne faults we must not be severe.

Not always will the chords ring sharp and clear

The notes we wish, but give out sharp sor flat;

Nor 'always hits the shaft its quarry pat.

When beauties shine at every turning, who

Can be offended by a speck or two,

Which human weakness, or some want οἷ care,

Perchance has sown or left unnoticed there?

What the conclusion, then, I draw from this?

Just as the -copyist, who spells amiss

W‘ords he’s been chid before for spelling wrong,

Has -no excuse: as he, whose harp or song

At the same note keeps stumbling evermore,

Provokes our mirth,—so he, who o'er and o'er

Commits grave errors, ranks in my regard

With Choerilus, that incoherent bard,

Who keeps me on the grin from line to line,

Though here and there he strike out something fine ; 'h

Nay, when good Homer drops into a nap,

His knuckles I feel half inclined to rap,

* As to the Sosii, see Epist. Ι. 20, and note p. 335, ante. That a
book is profitable to its publishers is no longer a test of excellence.

† As to Choerilus, see Epistle 11. 1, p. 355, ante. There were
three poets of the name, but Horace apparently refers here, asin
his Epistle to Augustus, to the bard who accompanied Alexander the
Great into Asia. to sing his victories‚ and who, after having been sor
some time liberally rewarded, was ultimately disoerded, some say
severely punished, when that prince woke up to a consciousness of the
wretched quality os his laureate's writings. ‘¹ ‘rear him to pieoes for his
bad verses,'' eries the mob in '‘Julius emax-¹· (Act iii. sc. 3). as they
hustle off the unhappy Cinna,—a kind of practical criticism, which. if it
became popular, might lmd to a very comprehensive Massam of
Innocents. · ·
