more short-lived than he was. His sarm amused, but it did not
engross him. Rome, with its manifold interests and its circle οἱ
distinguished friends was his real home. The Sabine sarm was and

Why at this moment should the thought of the railway to Subiaco,
which we had seen in progress, intrude itself into the mind?
Alas! alas! If the virtues of the brook should become widely
known, who can say that a few years hence the pilgrim to this

classic ground may not find all its wild boeuty gone, and a hnge ·
