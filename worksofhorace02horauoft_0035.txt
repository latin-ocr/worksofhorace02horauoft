Imggeredwithaepffinotsosteadyasfiee,
'suadem-which, alas! shows no favourtomes*
And there, on that threshold osbeauty and scorn,
Heigho! my poor bones lay and ached till the mom.
Now I'm all for Lycisca—more mincing than she
Can no little woman in daintiness be—
A love, neither counsel can cure, nor abuse,
Though 1 feel, that with me it is playing the denec,
But which a new fancy for some pretty face,

⁸ Or tusses of laese-flowing amber, may chase.
