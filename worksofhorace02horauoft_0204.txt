Satira III. [noox u.

But are his sound, who makes him free

Os cash on credit? Let us see!

‘⁴ Take this‚'' if I to you shall say,

“ Take it—you never need repay ! '³

Which proves your wits most out of tune,—

To take, or to refuse the boon,

Mercurius puts at your command?

You take your debtor’s note of hand

For money had—one thousand pound—

Of Nerius 3 nay, you take him bound

In all the penalties and pains

Devised by hard Cicuta's hrains,

Clap setters on him great and small,—

Sly Proteus still evades them all. ι

Drag him to court, his face all grin

At taking you so finely in;

And to all shapes at wiu turns he,

Now boar, now bird, now rock‚ now tree.

If he's a fool, who makes a mess

of his affairs, and he no less

Is wise, who handles them with tact,

Then is Perillius' hrain, in fact,

For what you ne’er can reimburse

To take your note, unsound or worse.
Hear, if ye prize your spirit's health,

All ye who pine for power or wealth,

Ye, who in luxury waste your bloom,

Or crouch in superstition’s gloom,

All ye, whose wits are by disease

Infested, be it what you please,

Draw nigh and listen, while 1 teach

That men are maniacs, all and each.
Men rich in gold, who thirst for more,

Should most be drenched with hellebore,-
