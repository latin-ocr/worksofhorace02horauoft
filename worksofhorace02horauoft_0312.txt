298 To Fuscus Aristius. [8003 1.

1f it be proper, as it ever was,
To live in consonance with nature's laws:
Or if we'd seek a spot whereon to raise
A home to shelter our declining days,
What place so fitting as the country? Where
Comes nipping winter with a kindlier air?
NVhere find we breezes balmier to cool
The fiery dog-days, when the sun's at suu?
Or where is envious care less apt to creep.
And scare the blessings of beart-casing sleep?
Is floor mosaic, gemmed with malachim,
One hals so fragrant or one half so bright
As the sweet herbage ? Or the stream town-sped,
That srets to burst its cerements os lead.
More pure than that which shoots and gleams along,
Murmuring its low and lulling undersong?
N ay, nay, your veriest townsman loves to shade
With sylvan green his stately colonnade;
And his is deemed the finest house which yields
The finest prospect of the open fields.
Turn Nature, neck-and-shoulders, out os door,
She’ll find her way to where she was besore;
And imperceptibly in time subdue
NVealth’s sickly fancIes, and her tastes untrue.

The man that’s wholly skill-less to descry
The common purple from the Tyrian dye,
Will take no surer harm, nor one that more
Strikes to his marrow in its inmost core,
Than he who knows not with instinctive sense
To sever truth from falsehood and pretence.
Whoe'er hath wildly wantoned in success.
Him will adversity the more depress.
What's clearly prized we grudgingly forego.
Shun mighty aims; the lowliest roof may know
