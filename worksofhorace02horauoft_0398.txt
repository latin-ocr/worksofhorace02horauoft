384 T lte Art os Poetry.

He shirks whate’er he seels by nature such,

Nothing can make it sparkle ’neath his touch :

And by poetic glamour so deceives,

So subtly fact with fiction interweaves,

F its part to part, beginning, middle, close,

That the great whole up to its climax grows.
You who to same upon the stage aspin-e.

Mark then what 1 and all the town require.

1f you would have your audience keep their seats

Till the last actor the old tag repeats,·¹·

³ Give all your characters a tone, a hue,

Both to their years and to their natures true.†
Soon as the boy can talk and make his way

Alone, he yearns with other boys to play.

Flies into passions, cools again as fast,

And shows a thousand moods that never last.
The beardless youth, from guardian freed at length,

Loves horses‚ dogs, and sports, and games os strength

Ductile as wax when he to vice is wooed,

Steel-hard to those who counsel him sor good;

Taking no heed to what will prove of use,

Enthusiastic, prodigal, profuse,

Full os wild longings, yet will cast away

The things he yearned sor most but yesterday.
What change comes o'er his spirit as ‘he nears

The middle term of manhood's riper years !

⁴* Vos plaudite ,Ι the formula which ended all the eomediae.

† lt is idle, as many writers do. to conti-ast Horaoe's sketch of child·
hood, youth, manhood, and age, in the four sucoeeding paragraphs,
with Shakespeare’s seven ages in “ As You Like 1t.·· Horace was only
pointing out how people of different ages ought to be drawn in comedy.
Had it been his hint to deal with the types of mankind as a whole,
what would have been oesier for him than to have brought into his pic-
ture a number of additional characters, illustrative of the nobler qualitioe
of humanity, both in action and in suffering, and all drawn with the
same firm outline and liveliness of truth ?
