356 To A agustus. [noox 11.

Mark how the sels-same king, who paid so dear
For poems that you laugh at when you hear,
Enjoined by edict, none should paint him save
Apelles, none in bronze his visage grave
Except Lysippus ; yet were you to put

T hat judgment, in art matters so acute.

To deal with books and poetry, you'd swear,
'Twas born and bred in dense Boeotian air.

But not of you will men such stories tell.
Virgil and Varius, whom you loved so well,
Extolled so highly, same will ever deem
VVorthy your bounty‚ worthy your esteem.

Not bust of bronze, carved e'er so destly, can
Express the outward semblance of a man
More to the life, than can a poet’s lay
A great man's mind and character portray.'¹‘·
Oh, it is not by choice I would compose
Things that, though verse, yet crawl like very prose,
When I might sing· of deeds of high emprise,
Of rivers vast, of lands ’neath distant skies,

Of citadels upreared on mountain crests,

of barbarous empires bowed to your behests,
Of conflicts sar as earth's wide bounds extend
Brought ’neath your auspices to happy end,

⁴* Observe how subtly Horace introduces his disclaimer of ability to
celebrate the triumphs os Augustus, to be followed by an enumeration of
them such asmust have satisfied the object of his eulogy to the fun.
Augustus, happy in his poets. was no less happy in the sculptors who
have preserved his outward lineaments in marble. And truly these
were worthy of a great artist's handling. Bautiful as the world has
long felt to be the bust of him in his boyhood, which is one of the
treasures of the Vadean, and has been multiplied in innumerable oop-
ies, it is sur-passed in interest by the fine full-length statue found a few
years ago at the Villa Livia, near Rome, and now also in the Vatican,
which represents the acknowledged “saviour of society ’” in the flower
of his manhood, and such as he was at the time this Epistle was ad·
dressed to him.
