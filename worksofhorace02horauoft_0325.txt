nrm-na xm] To Itis Bailiff 3 1 1

To litter down the steers at close os day.

And swell their wearied sides with leaves and hay:

Then, when the rain comes down in torrenta you

Find the brook gives your fat sides work to do,

And must be taught, by bank and bulwark checked,

To treat my sunward meadows with respect. ⁰
To sum up all 1 Now learn from me the cause

That you and me apart so widely draws.

He whom fine clothes became and glistering hair,

Whom Cinara welcomed,-—that rapacious fair,—

Though he came empty-handed, with delight;

He who of yore earoused from noon till night

Now quits the table soon, and loves to dream

And drowse upon the grass beside a stream,

Nor blushae that of sport he took his fill :—

He'd blush, indeed, to be tomsooling still.

In that calm spot no evil eye askance

Upon my simple comforts brings mischance.

Nor does cold hate, with slanderous fang obscure,

Its venom drop for my discomfiture.

True, as 1 turn a sod or shift a stone,

My neighbours laugh,-—no mighty harm. you'll own.

You're dying to be with my slaves in town,

Munching with them a scanty ration down;

Whilst they. shrewd rascals, envy you the use

Of what my gardens, woods and herds produce.
The lumbering ox sor housings longs; the steed

Thinks that to plough were happiness indeed :

Let meh* contentedly the calling ply

Which he is truly master of, say Ι.
