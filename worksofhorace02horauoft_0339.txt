EPISTLE XVIII.
‘ro nonnus.

F 1, dear Lollius, have rightly read
Your high and generous spirit, you would dread
It should be thought. beneath the guise of friend
You could to play the parasite descend; ⁴
Two parts that are as much uulike, or more,
As the staid matron and the high-rouged whores*
Yet there's a vice the opposite of this,
That's quite as bad, or even more amiss:
A rude gruff boorishness, whose arts to win

Are dirty teeth. and an unshaven chin,

On which some people plume themselves, forsooth,
As honest bluntness, and plain downright truth.
Here, as elsewhere, true wisdom’s course is proved
To be from both extremes alike removed.

The obsequious sycophant, who keeps the guests
Of the third couch a-titter with his jests,†

⁴* This. one of Horaoe's finest Epistles, is addressed to the same
young man ns the Second Epistle of this Book. It has been stmngely
mismd by Mr Madame, in his admirable edition of Horace, as a lesson
to an ingenuous youth· ‘to school his tongue and manners to a refined
servility.’ ” On the contrary. its aim seems to be to encourage him to
pei-severe in the hig-her virtues ; but if he is to mix in the world. and to
make his way with those on whom his success there will depend. to
teach him the necessity of making that sacrifice of his own likings and
humours,—eultivating the tact‚ in short, which constitutes the essence
of good manners. How his sels-respect and ultimate happiness are to
be maintained. how truly independent these ase of worldly honours or
sodal distinction, Horace very claerly and boeutifixlly indioetoe by the
concluding paragraphs of the Epistle.
