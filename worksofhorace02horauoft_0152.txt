138 Satira V. [BOOK 1.

But by its features may be guessed;
For water, elsewhere commonest

Of all things, here is sold like wine,
But then their bread's so sweet‚ so fine,
That prudent travellers purvey

A stock to last beyond the day.

For the Canusian’s full of grit,

And yet is water every whit

As scarce within that town, of old
Founded by Diomede the holds*

Here Varius lest us, sad of hoert,
And sadder we from him to part.

To Rubi † next we came, and weary,
For the long road was made more dreary
And comfortless by lashing rain.

Next day the weather cleared again,

But worse and worse the road up to

The walls of fishy Barium‡ grew:

Thence to Egnatia,§ built, although

The water nymphs said plainly, no!
Which food for jest and laughter made ηε,
In the endeavour to persuade us,

ὕ Canusium (modern Canosa), one of the ancient Greek settlements
of Apulia. The bread of the modern town 'ts as badas in Horaoe’s
time. in the same way, and probably from the same muse—being full

of grit from the sost nature of the iniustones used for grinding the corn π

of the locality.

ἦ· The modern Ruvo, thirty miles from Canusium.

’ζ The modern Bari, an important town upon the coast, occupying
a roeky peninsula, about a mile in circumference. 1t is twenty-two
miles from Rubi. It has now upwards os 5o‚0oo inhabitants, and is still
famous for its fish, and the “most ancient and fishlike flamm-'¹ of its
atmosphere.

ξ This was another seaport town, thirty-seven miles from Barium.

Its ruins still exist, about five miles south of the town os Monopoli, near ‚

the Torre d' Egnazia.
