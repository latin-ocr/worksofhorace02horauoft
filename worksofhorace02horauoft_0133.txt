»σοι 1.] Satire III. 1 19

With idle gossip boring you, we say, ,
Of common-sense he lacks the saintest ray.

Aias l how rashly we our metina lend
θ’ To laws mustwringour withers in the end!
Forno manlives but has his saults3 and best
Is he who by the smauaet is opproesed. ·
A good kind friend should, therefore, whensoe'er
My virtues with my faults he would compare,
Unto my many virtues more incline,
Especially if many such be mine.
So shall he win my favour, so the same
Allowance for himself in turn shall claim.
For, who would have his friend his wens o'erlook,
The casua! sreckloe of that friend must brock,
And the same mercy should by us be shown
To others’ sins we ask for to our own.
ἓξ Now to another point l Since it is plain
That to uproot the vice of wrath were vain,
Or other kindred vices which the schools
Assure us cling inherently to fools,
Why does not raeson unto them apply
Her weightsmd mensures, and each culprit try,
Appraise his crime, and punish or disgrace
According to the nature of the case ?
1f a man erucify his slave, because
He eats the sci-aps of fish and hals-chined sauce
Which from the board he carries, will he not
By all sane men even more insane be thought
Thau Labeo’s sels ? Yet how much madder is
Your conduct, and more culpable than his ?
A friend, we’ll say, has done you some despite,
Which any but a churlish nature might
Frankly o’erlook; yet him you hate and shun,
As debtors Druso fly, that dreary dun,
