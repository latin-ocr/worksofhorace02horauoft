been instigated by the young man's father. Only because he held
the youth in high regard, and felt that there was a vein of strong
sense in him to which he might appeal, would Horace have been
at pains to treat his subject at such length, and with so much eam-
estness. He seems to have been determined that the young man,
who was then only about seventeen or eighteen years old, should
not lose caste by mistaking the “puffs of dunces” sor fame, and
incurring the ridicule of that large classwho, in what is called soci-
ety, have a cynical delight in dwelling on ‘⁶ the follies of the wise.''

These were words (lines 450-452), especially coming aster what
preceded them, to give young Piso pause. It is characteristic of
Horace that, having written them, he at once glauces off into a ludi-
crously exaggerated picture of a crack-brained poet, and advocates
the propriety of letting him indulge his madness in suicide if he likes;
—a very skilful way of winding up a letter written with the object
above indicated, but which Horace would have felt to be a most
lame and impotent conclusion to a purely didactic essay on the art
which, of all arts, he prized the most. One would like to know how
Horace's advice was taken by the poet of the Piso family. If he
kept his verses by him, as suggested, for nine years, we may feel
sure that by that time he admired them as little as Horace appears
to have done what he had seen of them.

Of all Horace’s writings, none probably presents so many diffi-
culties to the translator,—none has been so often translated in all
the languages of Europe, or afforded so much scope for critical
comment and illustration. Its leading maxims can never be obso-
lete or out of place.]
