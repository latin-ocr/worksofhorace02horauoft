194 Satira III. [noox 11.

Would hoot you for a maniae. ’S life,

Poison your mother, choke your wife,

Yet say, your brain's undamaged? “ How?”

'Tis not at Argos done, 1 trow,

Nor with cold steel‚ as by insane

Orestes was his mother slain.

Think you, 'twas only when he slew

His parent, that so mad he grew,

Nor was by demons crazed, before

He warmed his dagger in her gore?

Not so 3 for, from the time he went

Quite mad by general consent,

Can you one single action name,

Which one could reasonably blame?

Neither on Pylades he drew

His sword, nor at Electra ssew.

He curses both, 1 grant you, well,

Her as a Fury, hot from hell,

And hitn by every name unblaet,

His towering anger could suggest.
Opimius, poor amidst untold

Amounts of silver and of gold,

Who'd drink from mug of common clay

Veientan ¹¹* on a holiday,

But would at other times regale

On any wash‚ however sta1e‚

Once sank into a lethargy

So grave, that in triumphant glee

His heir stood waiting by to seize

Upon his eoffers and his keys‚

When a quick-witted, honest leech

Awakes him thus to sense and speech.

⁴* A common red wine from the neighbourhood of Veii.
