‚nox 1.] Satire IV. 129

This is the deadly henbane, this the true corrosiye style,

⁴ ⁴ which never writing shall os mine, no, nor my soul defile!

This much 1 truly vow, if aught 1 of mysels may vow;

'- . Tben should my humorous vein run wild, some latitude allow.
, ⁷ 1 learned the habit from the best of fathers, who employed

Some living type to stamp the vice he wished me to avoid.
Thus temperate and frugal when exhorting me to be,
And with the competence content, which he had stored sor me ;
‘⁴ Look, boy !” he'd say, “ at Albius’ son—observe his sorry
plight!

ζ '2 And Bamxs, that poor begga: there! say, are not these a sight,
⁴ To warn a man from squandering his patrimonial means ?'’

When counselling me to keep from vile amours with common
queans3

“ Sectanus, ape not him !'’ he’d say,; or urging to sorswear

Iun-igue with matrons, when 1 might taste lawfiil joys else·
where 3

“Trebonius’ fame is blurred, since he was in the manner

 

oeught.

The reasons why this should he shunned, and why that

should be sought,

, The sages will explain ; enough for me, if 1 uphold
. ⁷ ΤῙιο saith and morals handed down from our good sires of old,
5 And, while you need a guardian, keep your life pure and your

name.

ᾗ when years have hardened, as they will, Your jndg'ment and

your statne,

And finds, with keen discriminating sight.
Blaek's not so black. nor white so very white.

'Save me. oh save me, from th'e Candid Friend.''

-’ ¹ Petillia: Capitolinus is said to have stolen the mown stom the statue of
‘ Jupiter in the Capitol. But this, like many other storia about char-
* actus named by Hor-aee, rests on mere conjecture. He had obviously
’ί uncle a narrow &cape from being convieted of some serious charge.
