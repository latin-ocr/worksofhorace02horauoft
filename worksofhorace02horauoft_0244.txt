'Satira V I. [noox 11.

Escape,* and therefore, friend, be gay,
Enjoy life's good things while you may,
Remembering how brief the space
Allowed to you in any case!

His words strike home; and, light of beart,
Behold with him our rustic start,
Timing their journey so, they might
Reach town beneath the cloud of night,
Which was at its high noon, when they
To a rich mansion found their way,
Where shining ivory couches vied
With coverlets in purple dyed‚

And where in baskets were amassed

The wrecks of a superb repast,

Which some few hours before had closed.
There, having first his friend disposed
Upon a purple tissue‚ straight

The city mouse begins to wait

With scraps upon his country brother,
Each serap more dainty than another,
And all a servant's duty proffers,

First tasting everything he offers(

The guest, reclining there in state,
Rejoices in his altered fate,
o’er each fresh tidbit smacks his lips,
And breaks into the merriest quips,
When suddenly a banging door .
Shakes host and guest into the floor.
From room to room they rush aghast,

And almost drop down dead at last,

θ “ Men must endure
Their going henee. even as their coming himer:
Ripeness is all.”
—King Lar. v. 2.
