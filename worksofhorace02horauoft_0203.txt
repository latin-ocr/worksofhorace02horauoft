,σοι ιι] Satira III. 189

whoseofltsatyou,isquiteasfi›ai1,
Ami dags as ludiemus a taiL*
One kind off solly is, to sear,
When there is nothing dmdful neas,
Like him, to whom a flat plain seems
Blockedupbyfirqandrockaandstreams.
Another, different indeed, but quite
As idiotic, will forthright
Dash on pac-mele through flood and fite.
Though mother, sister, wife and sire,
With all his kith and kin, shall shout,
‘¹ That ditch is deep—Look ont, look out!
That precipice immense !—Beware! ”
He’ll hear no more than did the play-er—
Old Fufius had caronse been keeping—
Who, acting Ilione sleeping,
Hasd not twelve hundred voices bawl,
“0 mother, mother, hm me call!”†
Thus all the herd are mad, somehow
Or other, as 1’11 show you now.

That Damasippus' hrains ase weak‚
He proves by buying busts antique.

⁴* Alluding to the old, and ever-new. trick of misehievous boys, to
fasten some appendage to the backs of half-witted people.

-1- The allusion here is apparunly to a soene in the play of ⁸ Ilione'
by Pacuvius, vhe-e the ghost of Deiphilus, appeafing in his mothet's
bedehamber, baeeeehae her togivehisbody burial in these words
(reported in Cieeto's ¹ Tusc. Disp: i. 44) :—

⁸¹ Mater, te adpello, quoe cumn somnos-ummo: levas
Neque te mei miseret: surge et sepeli natum.''

ζ ’Ᾰ Fufius was uae mone, catinus. another amor, the Deiphilus. The
·· ; mdienoe. finding Fufius immovable, seem. like the gods of our own

gallety. to have joined in the append: 1200, or, according to another
construction, 30,οω Catieni shonting, “Mater. te adpelle! '' Stin

⁷ ’ Fufius, the Kynaston of his day, slept on.
