222 Satira V. [Boon ιι.

His funeral left to your discretion, spate
No eost to give it an imposing air.
'Twill pay you well to let your‘ neighbours see
You do that dismal business handsomely.
Then if, perchance, one named joint heir with you

Shall have an ugly cough. Suppos‘ing‚ too,

He’s older than yourselss you’ll say to him,

“ If you, now, for my portion have a wffim,
House, grounds, or anything you like that’s mine,
For an old song 'tis yours !’' But Proserpine
Drags me away by her imperious spen.

Success attend your efforts ! Fare ye well!
