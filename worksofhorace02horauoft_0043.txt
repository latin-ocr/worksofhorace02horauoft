My yarth has ssed, my rosy hue

No παρίω have 1 from despair.

But bring me no reloese {mm paim
Noroen 1 ase, howe’er 1 gasp,
The spasm which holds me in its grasp.
So⁶am 1 vanquished, so reoent,
Uulneky merch! my creed, and grant,
Thac Sabine spells can vex the wit,
AndhadsbyMarsiccharmsbesplit.
Whatwouldst thoumme? Qearth! O sea!
Nor even Alcides burned like me,
With Neaeus’ venomed gore imbued,
Nor AEtna in its fiercest mood3
For till my flesh, to dust calcined,
Be matter-ed by the scornsul wind,
Thon εἰσῄει a very surnace fire,
Dmlling Colchian poisons dire!

Theransom,that shall set me free?
Spoek! Let the fine be what it may,
'that fine most rigidly 1¹11 pay.
Demand a hundred steerS, with these
Thy 'rath I’m mdy to appense Ξ
Or wonldst thou rather so desire
The praise of the inventive lyre,

ΤΙιοιι, chaste and good, shalt range afar
‘Hie spheres, thyself a golden star Ξ ι
Castor, with wrath indignant stung‚
And Castor’s brother, by the tongue‚

Thac slandered Helena the fair,

Yet listened to the slandeoer’s prayer,
Forgave the bard the savage slight,
Forgave him, and restored his sight.
