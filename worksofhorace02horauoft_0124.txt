Satire I.

But if, you say, you catch a cold, ’
Or any other illness hold
You fast in bed, you can provide
Some one to sit by your bedside,
To nurse and tend you, aud beseech v
The doctor with caressing speech,
To cure your ailments‚ and restore you

To kith and kindred‚ that adore you. . ·

'Tis all delusion! Neither wife Α

Nor son pray heaven to spare your life:
Neighbours, acquaintance, boy and girl,

All, all detest you sor a churl.

And can you wonder, you who deem
Mete wealth above all things supreme,
If none vouchsafe that loving thought,
For which your life has never wrought?
Nol In the chariot-race to train

A jackass to obey the rein

ι Were just as hopeless, as to win

Or keep the fond regards of kin
However near, or yet of friend,
Without some labour to that end-
Then let this lust of boarding censu
And, if your riches shall increase,
Stand less in dread of being poor,
And, having managed to secure
All that was once your aim, begin
To round your term os toiling in;
Nor act like that Ummidius, who
(Brief is the tale) was such a screw—
Although so rich, he did not count

His wealth, but measured its amount- ’

That any slave went better dressed,
And to the last he was possessed
