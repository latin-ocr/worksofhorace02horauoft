ΗΥ to the core of my inmost sense
Doth this mul-palsying torpor creep,
Asthough lhadquaffedtotheleaeadraught
Chargedwith thefumes ofLethoen sleep?

So Bathyllus of Samos tired, they tell,

'rhe brem omae Teian hard, who often
His passion bewailed on the hollow shell,

In mmures he stayed not to mould and sosten,
Yomtoqareonfirn butisfairthyflame

As she who caused Ilion its fateful leaguer,
Rejoice m thy lot; 1 am pining, oh shame!

For Phrynk, that profligate little intriguer.
