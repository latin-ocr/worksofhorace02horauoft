  

nrm-u ι] T o Manlius Torquatus. 281

1f you have better, send it here,
Or else be thanksul sor my cheer.
A handsome mansion os your own
For many and many a day you've known,
And furnished, too, in choicoet style;
Dismiss, then, idle hopes awhile,
The fight sor wealth, the raedeoe chase.
And every thought os Moschus' ease.
One morning's good long quiet drowse
To-monuw's holiday allows;
“ris Caesar’s blrfflday, and you may
Beguile the summer night with gay
Disoourse and genial mit-th, nor sear
You buy your holiday too dear.

Of what advantage walth to me,
ΠΙ touseitam notsree?
The man who's eaten up with care,
Who scrapes and pincha sor his heir.
Is next-door to a madman. Ι
For my part shall in future ply
The wine-cup well, and scatter flowers
Prosusely in my sestal hours:

,, Nor shall 1 care. though it be said

 

That 1 have fairly lost my head.

To what will 'mortal not aspire

Whose hrain good wine has filled with fire?
The secrets of the heart it opes,

To certainties turns trembling hopes,

And makes the craven and the cold
Pugnacious, resolute, and b01d;

It lightens care, it sostens pain,

Puts wit and wisdom in the brain.

Whom have not brimmers bn‘mmed with sense,
And kindled into eloquence‚‚—
