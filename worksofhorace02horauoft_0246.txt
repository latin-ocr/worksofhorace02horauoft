no doubt. ‘⁴ It flows as then it flowed,” and there is a sountain
there too, such as even less imaginative people than Horace would
be more than grateful to be able to mu their own.

How the families Horace speaks of had been cleared off the estate
one would like to know, sor it seems doubtful from Horace’s lan-
guage whether they continued to occupy it under him. It was not
likely to have been by the merciless process of eviction, to which
Horace alludes in terms of reprobation (Odes, ΙΙ. 18), when, as he

says— ⁸‘ Pellitur-paternos
In sinuserens Deos
E t uxor, et vir, sordidosque natas.”

“ Driven from home,
Both wife and husband forth must mam,
Bearing their household gods close pressed
With squalid babes upon their luteast?

For Maecenas was not a man to deal with old tenants in the ruth-
laes way common at the time to those who had made sudden
fortunes by not over-scrupulous means, and who dealt with their
new possessions without regard to the feelings or the happiness of
those whom they found upon the lands they bought. These were
among their country's worst enemies ; and Rome had reason in the

by throwing them into the hands of rich men ambitious osbeing
the owners-of vast estates maintained more for show than use. ·

But though the Sabine sarm was larger than Horace had longed
for, still it was clearly of very modest proportions. whatever

the solitude he loved‚ it certainly did not put money in his porse.
With his other small means, however, it insui-ed him a mmpetency,
and for him that was enough. It kept the wolf from his door, as
he tells Maecenas (odes, 111. 16), “Impar-tuna Pauperi& abat.”
He adds, “ Nec, si plura velim, tu dare ἀπομι-θ’

“ Nor wouldst thou, if more 1 wanted, Ο my friend, deny me me!

But, unlike most men who get what they have greatly desis-ed,
Horace did not want more„ and to the end of his days was wisely
content to enjoy his coveted possession without a wish to eulatge it.

This Satire was obviously written not long aster the liberality of
Maecenas had placed the Sabine sarm at his disposnlg and he could

have given his patron no stronger murance than by writing it, unt Α
