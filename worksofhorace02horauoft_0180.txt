166 Satira X. [noox 1.

But were he living now,—had only such
Been Fate’s decree,—he would have blot'ted much,
eut everything away, which could be called
Crude or superfluous, or tame, or ba1d; ’
Ost scratched his head, the labouring poet's trick‚
And bitten all his nails down to the quick.

Cast and recast, would you things worthy write
Of being read with ever—new delight.
To catch the crowd be not your labour berit,
But with some few choice readers be content.
Say, would you have—such aim were sure a soors-
Your verses mouthed in all the common schools? ·
Not so would 1 ε for ‘⁶ 'tis enough for me,
If to applaud me well the knights agree‚''
As, when Arbuscula* was hissed, she cried,
And with a look of scorn the mob defied.
What! Shall 1 wince, though bug Pantilius sting?
Or if, behind my back, Demetrius fling
Cold sneers at me? Or shall my spirit quail,
Though Fannius, that weak-witted creature, r'ail,
When with his friend Hermogenes he dines,-
Tigellius, I mean‚—at my poor lines?

If Plotius, Varius, and Maecenas, then,
virgil, and Valgius, Fuscus, best of men,
Octavius, too, and both the Visci praise,
These are the men I’d have‘approve my lays.
You, Pollio, without vanity‚ I might ·
Among that circle os admirers write,
And, dear Messala, with your brother you,
You also, Bibulus, and Servius too ;
With them, you, candid Furnius, 1 class,
And many more, whom prudence bids me pass,

ἱ Α celebrated actress os whom Cicero, in a letter to Atticus (iv. 15)
writes, “You ask me about Arbuscula. She has made a great hit 33

(valde placuit).''
