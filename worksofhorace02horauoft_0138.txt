SATIRE IV.

HE bards of ancient comedy‚ when rit was 31 113 11931,

Aristophanes, and Eupolis, Cratinus, and-the rest,

W'hene’er they had a mind to paint some notable 'for us,

Rogue, cut-throat, thies, adulterer, or some way infameris,

With fearless pencil dashed him off3 and this it is that makes

The merit of Lucilius, who followed in their wakes,

Their feet and measure only changed: bright was his wit,
and shrewd

His views of men and life, yet were his verses harsh and
crude.

For he was much to blame in this; that, as ’twere some great
seat,

Two hundred verses by the hour he 'd dictate at 3 11931;

Α muddy torrent, charged with much were 1191191· 0111 of
sight, ’ · - - ⁷

Words crowded in on 111111 so fast, hed take no 1131113 1ο1
write, —

WVrite well, Ι mean3 sor writing much, that¹s what 1 most
despise3

There even Crispinus knows his strength, and safely me
defles.

“Your tablets, quick, your tablets take,—-name umpires, time,

and place, , ⁴

And see, which can compose the most within the 3111111931
space !'’
