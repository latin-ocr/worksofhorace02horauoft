202 Satire III. [mox 11.

Which, flushed with revel, stin he wore,
When he was stricken to the core
By the undinnered sage‘s lore*

Offer a sulky boy a pean—
He thrusts it from him! “ Take it, dar! ’'
“ Ι won’t.'' Don’t press him further ς soon
He’ll pipe to quite another tune.
How like this case the banished lonr’s,
Who round the door that bans him hovers,
Asking himself—would he, ot no,
Back to the fair enslaver go,
To whom he'd only be delighted
To sneak, though he were uninvited ?
“ Now, when she calls me back, shall Ι
Consent? Had 1 not better die,
And end my pains, at once? Alack!
She shut me out, she calls me back.
Shau 1 ?—No! On her knees although
She beg and pray, I will not go! ”
Up comes his slave, who has pretence
To a more handsome share of sense ;
“ Things, sir, that own nor rule nor reason,
Gravely to treat were out of season.
Love is a chaos all perplexed ;—
'Tis war one bour, and peace the next ;
And any· man who racks his thought,
To give stability to what
Is all haphazard, changefuh blind,
Wild and unstable as the wind,

with some os his companions from an orgy, entered the school of
Xenophanes, and was so much struck by the lecmre os the great
Platonist, that he qcted as mentIoned in the text, like him who, in
our own poet's words, having “come to soom remained to pmy.'' ν
The story is told by Diogenes Laertius, iv. c. 16.
