282 To Manlius Torquatus. [nont r.

VVhom set not from his bondage free,
Though settered fast in poverty?

Then come, and I’ll take care you find
That everything is to your mind 2-—
The coverlets of saultless sheen,

The napkins scrupulously clean:

Your cup and salver such that they
Unto yourself yourself display:

No chu'rl that out of doors will spread “⁸'‘
What ’mongst familiar friends is said.
Nor one that does not take his share
On equal terms with any there.

Butra 1²11 ask, Sulpicius too,

To come¹ and hob and nob with you;
Sabinus also shall be there,

Unless he be engaged elsewhere,

Or flirting with some girl whom he
Prefers to any company.

There's room sor others, if you choose,
Or any that you can't refuse;

Though guests packed close, I pray you note,
Are apt to savourrof the goat.†
