The things this country place of mine will grew,

If it enrich me with oil, apples, wine,
Or ir its fields are best sor eoru or kine,
Its site and character I'win may
To picture for you in my chatty way*

Girdl'ed by hius it nes, through which but one
Small valley, rich in shade, is seen to run,
Where on the right the morning sunbaems play,

Purply and dark, in rich profusiori grow,
While oak and ilex bounteously afl'ord
Food sor my herds. and shelter sor their lord.

“ Tarentum’s here, with all its wealth of green.”

To give the stram, whose source it is, a name:
