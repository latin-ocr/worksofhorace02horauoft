arom ιι] Α βᾶἰιιε.

The Afric hen or the Ionic snipe, ⁴

Thau olives newly gathered from the tree,
That hangs abroad its clusters rich and ripe,
μ Οι· sorrel, that doth love the pleasant lea,

 

Or mallows wholesome for the body's need,
Or lamb soredoomed upon some festal day
In offering to the guardian gods to bleed‚
Or kidling which the wolf hath marked sor prey.

What* joy, amidst such feasts, to see the sheep,

Fun of the pastum, hurrying homewards come,
To see the wearied oxen, as {hey breep,

Dragging the upturned ploughshare slowly home!

Ξ Or, ranged around the bright and blazing heartb,
To see the hinds‚ a house’s surest wealth,
Beguile the evening with their simple mirth,
And all the cheerfulness of rosy health!

Thus spake the miser Alphius ; and, bent
Upon a country lise, called in amain

The money he at usury had lent 3
But ere the mouth was out, 'twas lent again.
