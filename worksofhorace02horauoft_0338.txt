324 To Scoeva. [noox 1.

The man who, taken as companion down
To sair Surrentumss or Brundisium town,
Of roads ill made and badly kept complains
Goes grumbling on about the cold and mins,
Of trunk broke open tells sad tales, and how
He's lest with nothing sor his journey now,
Is like your courtesan, with eyes 'all swollen,
Now sor a bracelet, now an anklet stolen,—
Device so stale, that when some real grief
Or loss o’ertakes her, she gets no belief.
Who, that has once been hoaxed, will from the street
Pick up and set a eripple on his feet?
Though tears stream down his cheeks, though he invoke
Osiris. “’Tis no sham ! My leg is broke Ξ
Oh, cruel, not to list me !’' “ Catch a flat ! ’¹
The whole street eries ε “ We're not so green as that ! ” ἵ·

reminded of this passage quite receutly (April 1881)as he drove down
from Fiesole to Florence. As the mniage approached, a man dropped
suddenly upon some broken stonoe which had just been spread on the
macadamised road, and Iay in an affected stupor, and with somn ooz-
ing from his mouth. ‘⁸ Never mind him !'' said our adver. “Have
seen him do it often. A mere trick to move your pity. Knowhim
well. A thoroughly bad senow. 'Calli-va gentest’ We remembered
Horace’s ¹·Quaere peregrinum !'’ and left the soamp to get out of
his stony bed as best he might.
