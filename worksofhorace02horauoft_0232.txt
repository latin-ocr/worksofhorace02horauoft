2 1 8 satire V. [uoox 11.

The voiceless statues, or stout Furius throw

On wintry Alps a coverlet of snow.·¹·

“ Do you not see,'' some stander·by will say,

Nudging his neighbour’s elbow by the way,

“ What zeal he shows, what patience, sor his friends}

How sharp he is, how keen, to serve their ends ?’'

More gudgeons will anon come swimming round,

And in your fish-ponds presently be found.
Again,—-you see a son in feeble health;

An only son, reared in the lap os wealth.

Old bachelors should draw surrnise on you,

To manage things so dexterously there,

Th2t you are named the next to him as heir.

And so, should any chance to Orcus chase

The sickly lad, you step into his place.

This ruse is all but certain to succeed.

Should a man offer you his will to read,
Refuse of course, and push, with some display
Of wounded pride, the document away3
But, while you do so, by a glauce divine
What names appear upon the second line,—

If you alone are named in it as heir,
Or with a score of others merely share-¹1·
