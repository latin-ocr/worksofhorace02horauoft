26 To tlte Roman People. [aroma xv1.

'Where'er our wandering steps may chance to carry us should
go,

Or wheresoe’er across the seas the fitful winds may blow.

How think ye then? If better course none offer, why should we

Not seize the happy auspices, and boldly put to sea?

But let us swear this oath3—“Whene’er, is e‘er shall come
the time,

Rocks upwards from the deep‘shall float, retum shall not be
crime; ·

Nor we be loath to back our sails‚ the ports of home to seek,

When the waters of the Po shall lave Matinum‘s rifted peak,

Or skyey Apenninus down into the sea be rolled,

Or wild unnatural desires such monstrous revel hold,

That in the stag’s endearments the tigress shall delight,

And the turtle-dove adulterate with the falcon and the kite,

That unsuspicious herds no more shall tawny lions sear,

And the Ine-goat, smoothly sleek of skin, through the briny
deep career!⁷'

This having sworn, and what beside may our retuming stay,

Straight let us all, this City’s doomed inhabitants, away,

Or those that rise above the herd, the few os nobler soul;

The craven and the hopeless here on their ill-starred beds
may loll.

Ye who can feel and act like men, this woman’s wail give o’er,

And fly to regions far away beyond the Etruscan shore l

The circling ocean waits us3 then away, where nature smiles,

To those fair lands, those blissful lands‚ the rich and happy
Isles !

Where Ceres year by yeae· crowns all the untilled land with
sheaves,

And the vine with purple clusters droops, unpruned of all her
leaves3 ⁶

Where the olive buds and burgeons, to its promise ne’er -
untrue, .

And the russet fig adorns the trec, that graffshoot never knew3
