S atire J.

Like the poor slave, that bears the sack
Of loaves upon his aching back,
You’ll get no more, no, not one jot,
Than does his mate, who carries nought-
Or say, what boots it to the man,
Who lives within boon Nature’s plan,
Whether he drive his ploughshare der
A thousand acres or five score?

But then, you urge, the joy is deep
Of taking from a bulky heap.
Stin, if we're free to pick out all
Our needs require from one that’s small,
What better with your hams are you,
Than we with our poor sack or two?
Let us imagine, you desire
Some water, and no more require
Than might be in a jar ta’en up,
Or ev'n in, shall we say, a cup ?
‘⁴ 1 will not touch this trickling spring3
But from yon rolling river bring
What store I want‚” you proudly cry.
well, be it so Ξ But by-and-by
Those who still strive and stt-ain, like you,
For something more than is their due,
By surly Aufidus will be
Swept with its banks into the sea3
Whilst he, who all—abundant thinks
What for his wants suffices, drinks
His water undefiled with mud, v
Nor sinks unpitied in the flood.

But most men, blinded and controlled
By the delusive lust of gold,
Say that they never can obtain
Enough3 because a man, ·they're fain
