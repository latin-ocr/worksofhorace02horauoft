By potions never used before
, Shalt to my feet be brought once more.
And ’tis no Marsian charm shall be
The spell that brings thee back to me!
A draught 1⁷11 brew more strong, more sure,
le wandering appetite to cure;
And sooner ’neath the sm the sky
Shall sink, and earth upon them lie,
Than thou not burn with fierce desire
For me, like pitch in sooty fire 1 ”

On this the boy by gentle tones

No more essayed to move the mones,
But wildly forth with srenzied tongue
These curses Thyestean flung:
“Your sorceries, and spells, and charms
To man may compass deadly harms,
But hmven's groet law of Wrong and Right
Will never bend before their might.
My curse shall haunt you, and my hate
No victim’s blood shall expiate.
But when at your behests I die,
Like Fury of the Night will 1
From Hades come, a phantom sprite‚—
Such is the Manes’ awful might,—
With crooked najls your cheeks I'll tear,
And squatting on your bosoms scare
with hideous fars your sleep away 1*

' Then shall the mob, some future day,

³ '¹ Insequar et vultus ossea larva tuos.-
Me rugilam· cernes, tacitis ego noctis in umbn's
Excutiam somnos, visus adesse. ἔασι-3·

Waking thou shalt behold me ς in the night's
