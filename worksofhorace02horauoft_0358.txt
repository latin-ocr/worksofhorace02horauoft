He, o’er whose grave a hundred years have passed,

I want to know where he is to be classed?

Amongst the ancient, and the immaculate,

Or with the worthless, as of modern date?

N ame some fixed term, all cavil to arrest.

¹‘ If of a hundred years he stand the test,

passed into his body. Horace, somewhat unjustly, seems to think
that there was more of the peacock than of Homer in the father of
the Latin epic. Against the grudging testimony borne by Horace to
the merits of Ennius may be set the fact, that his works retained their
popularity down to the time of Martial. Lucretius and Virgil did not
disdajn to borrow from him, and Quintilian (Inst. Or.. X. 1-88) calls
upon his readers to “venerate him, as they do the sacred groves, the
grand old trec-stems in which have the charm rather of sacred associa-
tions than of boeutyst Horace himself admits and admires his admi·
rable good sense, and the manly dignity of his moral tone, however
