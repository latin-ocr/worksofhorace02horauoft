Satin IV.

Although in beauty they excel,
The apples do not taste so well,
Which come from Tibur, all must own,¹
As what ate at Picenum grown.

Pots with Venuculan grapa ὅμως
The Alban dried in smoke should be. ,
1 was the fixst, with the dessertf-

My claim let no one cona-oven,—
To serve up these 3-the first, to boot,
To serve caviare with the fruit,

And b1aek salt, with white pepper dumea,

On little plates sor every guest.

'Tis monstrous upon fins to throw
Away two hundred pounds or so,
And huddle heaps of vagrant fish
anthia the bounds of one small dish.

It makes one siclt, a slave to see
With the same greasy hands which he
Has from the dishes slobbered up
Stolen snacks withal, present your cup,
Or have some ancient beaker set
Before you smeared with dirt and wet.
what is the cost of common brooms‚
Dusters‚ and sawdust for your rooms Ρ
A bagatelle in any case!
To want them infinite disgrace.
Would you with filthy besoms sweep
A rich mosaic floor, or heap γ
with Tyrian stuffs a couch bedight
with grime, and filth,—sorgetting quite
Tlmt carelessness, in what, at most,
Demands both little care and eost,
Is worse, and more to be deplored‚
Thanto have lackingat yourboard
what only rich men mn afford.
