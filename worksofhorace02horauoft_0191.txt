, Heme, then, 1 take my stand. And so,

VOL. 11.

Ualens, ,Trebatius you mn show
Strong reason on the other side,
In this resolve 1 shall abide.

TREBATIUS.
So be it 2 But lest you, perchance,
Should stumble through your ignorance
Of law into a serape, 1 may
One warning hint before you lay:
If any man iu verses pen
Against a sennar-citizen,
Justice aud judgment shall ensue.

HORACE.
1 grant you, if ill verses‚—tme.
But if they’re good, then all men praise,
And Caesar’s sels confers the bays.
If any man shall lash, and soundly‚
Some feuow who deserves it roundly‚ -
while tione to his own door can bring
Such flaws as give his lines their sfing,

The court with laughter cracks its sides,

And off the bard in tn'umph rides.
