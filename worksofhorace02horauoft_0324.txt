3 10 To leis Bailzff. [uoox ι.

My mind transports me thither, and Ι strain

To burst the barriers that my steps restrain.

Oh, blest are they who dwell in town, you sigh !

Blest they who in the country dwell, say Ῑ.

The man who’s envious of another’s state

His own is sar upon the way to hate;

And we, poor fools,—in this we’re all the same,—

The spot we live in most absurdly blame,

When we should blame ourselves, that never may

Get from themselves and their own whims away.
Drudge of my house in Rome, your silent prayer

Was all sor farmy fields an‘d country fare.

I made you bailiff of this farm of mine,

And now for town, for baths and shows, you pine.

I am, you know, consistent, and depart

For Rome at all times with a heavy heart,

When business, hatesul business. drag’s me there.

Your tastes with mine, 1 see, will never square;

For 'twixt us two the difference is this,

What you most fancy, 1 take most amiss.

What to your eyes are rough and dreary wastes,

Are exquisite to those who share my tastes,

While they detest what you think fine. A wench,

The greasy luxury of a tavern bench,-

’Tis these, I see, that make you long for town :

And you on that dear nook of mine look down,

Because the spice os Eastern elimes, you know,

As soon or sooner there than wine will grow;

Because, too, there's no tippling·house hard by

To drop into whenever you feel dry,

Nor piping jade, your heavy heels to set

Jigging and jumping to her flageolet.

Yet there are lots to do : to work the glade,

That has not known for years the touch ofspade;
