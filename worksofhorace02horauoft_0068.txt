54 Notes to tlte Odes.

The merits of Tibullus as an elegiast are of the first order. He
writes from the heart, and his poems abound in strokes of pathos
and tendemess which have never been sun-passed. Shakespeare,
Tennyson, or Browning, sor example, might have written such a
line as this :—

“ Non ego sum tanti, ploret ut illa semel.”

“ For what am 1, that she
Should shed so much as one poor teat sor me?''

Indeed in subtle tenderuess of feeling it is closely akin to Shake-
speare's—

“ For I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
If thinking of me then should make you woe.”

His powers os expression are admirable, his imagery risa up
clearly and spontaneously, and the glow of genuine passion inspires
and vivifies his gracesully modulated verses. A poet who brings
before us such pictures as the following, can never be old. He is
lying dangerously ill at Corcyra, and thus appeals to his Delia,

whom he has left at Rome, and of whose constancy he appears to ,-

have even then had misgivings—not without cause, as the event
proved :—

“ O love, be true l And ever near thee hold,

To ward thy chastity, that ancient dame!

Let her beguile thine ears with legends old,
And spin long threads by the lamp's waning flame :

And let thy maids around that, as they run
“ Their nimble spools, a listening silence keep ς
From their o’erwearied fingers one by one
The spindles drop, and dream away to sleep.

Then shall Ι burst upon thee, as though 1
Had dropped from heaven! Then, Delia, O my sweet,

Howe'er thou art arrayed, to meet me fly, .
With hair dishevelled, aud unsandalled feet l
