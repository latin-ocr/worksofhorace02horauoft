392 'slce A rt of Poetry.

F ool that Ῑ am, whenever spring draws nigh,

To purge myself of bile and vapours dry ! ,

Did 1 resrain, where is the living wight

Who better poems than myself could write?

well, well, no matter ! I will play the hone,

That gives an edge, but has none of its own:

Myself not writing, I will teach what makes

A poet's excellence, show whence he takes

The riches of his art, the grace, the charm,

And what is fraught with good, and what with hanni
In all sound writing, knowledge and good sense

Lie at the very root of excellence*

To the Socratic page sor matter go t

Once master that, and words will sreely flow.

He who has learned to feel and comprehend

His duty to his country, to his friend, .

The love that's due to parent, brother, guest,

What makes the judge, the senator, what best

Will qualisy to lead a great campaign,—

That man, be sure, will hit the proper vein,

And by their thoughts, their feelings, language, acta

Make all his characters true living facts.

The world of life and manners is the book

To which the dramatist must always look,

To find those types of men, and diction ton,

Which all the world shall recognise as true.

If true to lise and to the human heart,

A play, though void of beauty, soree, and art,

More charms an audience, holds them in its spell,

Than vapid trifles, sound they ne’er so well.

ἦ Scribendz‘ recte sapere est et principt‘um et flms. A maxim which
every young writer should ever keep before his mind. Out of the fulness
of knowledge, as well as of the heart, let the mouth speak. Cicero said
before Horace, ⁴¹ Ipsae res verba rapiunt.'' Have something to say that

is worth saying, and it will drag words from you. “Le veritable
orateur‚'' says Fenelon, “ pense, sent, et la parole suit.·’
