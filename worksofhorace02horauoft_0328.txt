314 To Numenius V ala. [soon 1.

All this, my dear Vala, you’re bound to indite,
And I to believe every word that you write.
When Maenius had gallantly gobbled down all
The fortune his parents had lest at his call,
F orced to live on his wits‚ and to dine where he could,
He hung on anywhere, making jokes for his sood.
Is nobody asked him, oh then ’twas the deuce Ξ
He pelted all round, friend and soe, with abuse.
The butchers beheld him with terror and awe;
All he got found its way to his bottomless maw.
XVhen little or nothing from those could be wrung,
Who liked or who dreaded his seurrilous tongue,
He would dine on huge platefuls of tripe, or cheap lamb,
Nor could any three bears down such quantities cram,
Protesting, as Bestius, that excellent man, did,
That gourmets should all on the belly be branded.
And yet, if he chanced on some daintier prey,
When ’twas picked to the very last bone, he would say,
‘⁴ By the gods l now, it does not surprise me to hear
Of people who spend all their means on good eheer!
Than an ortolan plump what can be more divine,
Or the unctuous paps of a nine-farrowed swine?”*
That's my own very sels. When no better I see,
Oh, the simple, the homely, the humble sor me Ξ
I’m a Stoic, with nothing to tempt me. But say
Something rich or more toothsome shall come in my way,
“They only are wise and live well,'’ I protest,
‘⁴ Who in fine country places † their money invest !’'

⁴* The connection between Maenius and the other parts of this Epistle
is not very apparent. But this graphio sketch of a character by no
means uncommon in modern life, is too valuable not to reconcile the
reader to im being brought in ὰ propos des bottes.

† Horace means rather suburban villas, ¹' villae urbanae,'' which were
often built upon a sumptuous scale.
