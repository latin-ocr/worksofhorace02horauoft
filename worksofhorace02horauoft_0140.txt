126 Satira IV. f [Boon 1.

First from the roll I strike myself of those 1 poets call,

For merely to compose in verse is not the all-in·all 3

Nor is a man shall write, like me, things nigh to prose akin,

Shall he, however well he write, the name of poet win.

To genius, to the man whose soul is touched with fire divine,

Whose voice speaks like a trumpet—note‚ that honoured name
assign.

So some have asked‚ if Comedy be poetry or no,

Since neither in its diction nor its characters the glow‚

The spirit, the concentred force, os poetry it shows,

And would, but for its rhythmic beat, be prose, and only
prose.

But 'twill be said, a father raves and storms in fiery lines,

Because his son, infatuate by a courtesan, declines

A bride with a stupendous dower, and reels, blind dmuk, by
day,

With torches (oh most dire disgrace ἔ) to light him on his way.

Now were Pomponius' sire alive, think you that youth would
hear

Reproaches pitched less high in tone, less statelily severe?

And therefore is it not enough, that you compose your verse

In diction irreproachable, pure, scholarly, and terse, ¹

Which, dislocate its cadence, by anybody may

Be spoken like the language of the father in the play.

Divest these things which now I write, and Lucilius wrote of
yore

Of certain measured cadences‚ by setting that before

Which was behind, and that before which 1 Iud placed
behind, ’

Yet by no alchemy will you in the residuum find

The members still apparent of the dislocated hard,

As if in like degree these lines of Ennius should be matred:

“ When direful Discord burst
The iton-hafted posts and gates of war.''
