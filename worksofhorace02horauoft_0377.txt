 

noox m] Epistle II. ἶ 363

Around the unfilled spaces of the dome,

That is to eanopy the bards of Rome*

Then follow, if you’ve leisure, not too near,

Yet near enough the reasons why to hear,

Make each so clamorous in the other‘s praise,

And to himself the while award the bays.

We lunge and parry, dodging in and out,

Like Samnites at a tedious feneing bout.

He hits me, quarte, Alcaeus l Good Ξ And he

Gets back Callimachus in tierce from me.

If more he seem to lack, Mimnermus then

Thrust home makes him the happiest of mensi·

Oh me, this tetchy race of bards is such,

That to propitiate them 1 bear with much,

So long as 1 too am a bard professe&

And bid for popular favour with the rest.

But once of this same scribbling mania clear,

They may recite, but won’t get me to hear.
Bad poets are a jest ; but they, poor elves,

Are blest and bend in homage to themselves.

If you be silent, in their raptui-e they

Unst‘mted tribute to their verses pay.

But he whose high ambition is to frame

A poem truly worthy of the name,

³ The library of Apollo on Mount Palatine seems to be meant. To
the poets of that day it was what the Poets' Corner in westminster
Abbey might be to ours.
